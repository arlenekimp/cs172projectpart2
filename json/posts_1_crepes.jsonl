{"id": "uwxj3", "title": "Do you think crepes are hard?", "body": "I learned how to make crepes from a Romanian woman about 6 or 7 years ago, and I have never had a problem making them. I cook mine on an induction stove top, in a stainless steel pan, and I rarely have difficulties with burning or sticking. Recently, however, I watched an episode of Good Eats where Alton Brown displays his phobia of making crepes. I tried talking to some friends about this, but none of them have ever made crepes. \n\nSo, where do you folks sit on this issue? Are crepes easy, or is my experience of never struggling with them uncommon?", "username": "Kants_Pupil", "upvotes": 9, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Crepes/comments/uwxj3/do_you_think_crepes_are_hard/", "permalink": "/r/Crepes/comments/uwxj3/do_you_think_crepes_are_hard/", "comments": ["Only problem I've had with crepes is producing a lot of them in a short amount of time. I've since resorted to using a few pans on all the burners so I don't spend an hour at the stove making crepes. I've used stainless and nonstick and haven't had any issues. Even my first batch came out perfect using a recipe I found online. I consider crepe making to be about as difficult as grilled cheese or scrambled eggs.", "I learned how to make crepes once in high school French class, promptly forgot it, and then learned from the Nintendo DS Personal Trainer: Cooking \"game\" and have made them every so often since.  The only part I find troublesome is, as chodemessiah pointed out, making a lot of them in a short amount of time (for me, that means making enough for my family in a short enough time we can all eat together without the crepes getting cold).  Other than that, the actual cooking is comparable to scrambled eggs or pancakes, in my experience.", "When cooking food that has a very short window between done and overdone it is fairly easy to make mistakes other than learning how to know when they are done the other hard part is consistently making them the same thickness throughout. Other than that though nothing to technically demanding about making crepes.", "I have actually never tried, but I wouldn't mind getting your recipe so that I could try to make them.", "no, but I'm hard for crepes.", "Certainly! \n\n\n    1 cup all-purpose flour\n    2 eggs\n    1/2 cup milk\n    1/4 cup water\n    1/4 teaspoon salt\n    2 tablespoons butter, melted\n    1/4 cup carbonated water\n\nMix flour and eggs for a moment, then add the milk and water, and once it is started to get to be a consistent and thin batter, add your salt and butter. Then, I let mine sit in the fridge at least 30 min and as long as over night. Warm up a pan who's base is the size you want your crepes to be, and put a small amount of butter or other cooking fat in, just enough to coat the cooking surface. While waiting for the pan to heat up, pour in the carbonated water into the batter and fold in until incorporated. Sorry, but my stove isn't particularly consistent in its heat because the elements aren't very well connected, so I am not sure what heat you need. I would estimate it is about the middle of the road on an average American electric range.\n\nUsing a ladle, measuring cup, or whatever else you have handy that can help you pour a consistent amount, pour just enough batter to make a thin coat on the bottom of the cooking surface. I like to pick up my pan and tilt until the whole bottom is covered, then set it down and let it cook, usually about a minute on each side. When you go to flip, there should be bubbles that have come up and stayed open, and the bottom is golden brown (it should lift right off the pan, so if it is hard to get under and pull up, just give it a few more seconds and then try again). Once flipped, let the bottom brown and then serve. \n\nPersonally, I like mine plain, with light sugar and butter, or with nutella. If you are planning on serving them as part of a particular meal, it is easy to add spices to compliment the flavors of other foods. I am not fond of sweetened crepes, but if you want one, just add sugar to taste when mixing your milk and water into the flour and eggs.\n"], "urlNames": [], "urlLink": [[], [], [], [], [], []]}

I love them with the syrup alone, but if you do want bacon, I think streaky is best. You can easily cook these pancakes by dolloping the batter onto a hot griddle (smooth, nor ridged, side) or heavy based pan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor US cup measures, use the toggle at the top of the ingredients list.\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\nServes: 4-6\n\nMETRICCUPS\n\n* 2\u00bd teaspoons baking powder\n* 1 pinch of salt\n* 1 teaspoon white sugar\n* 2 large eggs (beaten)\n* 30 grams butter (melted and cooled)\n* 300 millilitres milk\n* 225 grams plain flour\n* butter for frying\n\nMETHOD\n\n1. The easiest way to make these is to put all the ingredients into a blender and blitz. But if you do mix up the batter by hand in a bowl, make a well in the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar, beat in the eggs, melted butter and milk, and transfer to a jug: it's much easier to pour the batter into the pan than to spoon it.\n2. Heat a smooth griddle or pan on the stove.\n3. When you cook the pancakes, all you need to remember is that when the upper side of the pancake is blistering and bubbling it's time to cook the second side, and this needs only about 1 minute, if that.\n4.

When I was driving my beautiful Pontiac back from the most prosperous flour acquisition I saw a \"pancake house\" that had just opened its pitiful doors and I scoffed in the deepest, most pure disgust.  How morally lost would one have to be to make a pancake house?  So I went in to the house (of horrors! teehee) to give them a peace of my mind.   I said to the cashier, \"Would you most surreptitiously mind to sprinkle some delectable berries on it?\", and before his simple mind could respond I said \"Oh, I suppose you can't do that with a pancake?  Hahaha.  I see.  Can you contrast those berries with some well placed cheese or cinnamon?  How about some chocolate product?  Egg?  Spinach?  Okra?  Fennel?\"  At this point the horribly deluded pancake-head started to perspire.  So I revealed my pepper spray (empty, of course) and asked again, politely, at which point he started to make the sad attempt of the Gesamtkunstwerk of food that is the crepe.  But I chimed in, so cleverly, so intellegently, \"I'm not threatening you.  It just wouldn't compare to the indescribably beautiful, pure, life-affirming taste of a well-done crepe.  Your loss, my fellow.\"  I laughed on the way out.

I think it's mainly nostalgia but I do love pancakes. They are both beautiful in their own ways.", "I make  high protein crepes for breakfast at least once a week and more really because the batter last in the fridge for days. Mine are mostly eggs with a little flour . My folks love 'em .", "Cr\u00eapes are usually lighter and can be harmoniously paired with more options (both savory and sweet).  Healthiness wouldn't make a huge difference to me. And for the record, when done right, they're already on par with or better than pancakes.", "Honestly if I were to choose between the two I would hands down choose a yummy crepe. They already \"seem\" healthier/ better tasting because there's a wider variety of toppings, they can be sweet/savory, and they're not a fluffy as pancakes so it's not as carb heavy. Here's why I think Americans may like pancakes more than crepes:\n\n1. Pancakes in America are typically marketed as a traditional, American food. I don't even know where crepes originated but they always have a \"foreign\" feel since the only shops I ever see sell them are European or Asian. People tend to go towards the familiar.\n2. Crepes seem more expensive. For example, I can buy a box of pancake mix for $1 or less, or go out and have them at a restaurant for $6 or less. I don't usually see crepe mixes in stores, and they're usually $6-$10 in restaurants.\n\nOne thing about crepes that you can use to your advantage is the fact that they're a mobile food, but pancakes are definitely a sit down food. Idk if anyone's thought to do this yet, but I'm sure they'd sell really well at fairs and the like."], "urlNames": [], "urlLink": [[], [], [], []]}
