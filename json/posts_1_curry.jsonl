Next time I will do it and link it here.\n\nSo the first step is to bring everything I might need in a reachable distance because I often add a little bit of everything when I have the base done. \n\nOn the picture the part in the right lower corner is a self mixed, self grinded and roasted part with the following ingredients: Fenugreek (about 20%), cardamom (20%), mustard seeds (20%), black pepper (20%), Szechuan pepper (10%), cloves (10%). I roast them without oil or fat in a steel pan before grinding until the whole kitchen smells like it. Keep in mind that the %-Values are for the self-grinded part and not overall so if you change something you will need a lot more of these part. For example if you want a cardamom dominant curry you will need something like 50%. And be careful with Szechuan pepper, when roasted its extremely tasteful and if you don't want it to be in the focus, keep the value low. The overall value of the self mix is something like 15-20%.\n\nthe small light part right above the self mix is ginger powder, its definitely not needed if you use fresh ginger but I have it and don't have another usage for it so... why not.\n\nAbove that ginger the small red part is cayenne pepper. Above that the next one is cumin also 15-20%, left of the cumin is chilli powder (5%), Next one is sweet paprika powder (10%), On the left the next is cinnamon (10%... but I would chose a little bit less next time and use more chilli instead). Next one is a mixed tandoori curry powder (5%) which is similar to this one but with more chilli, paprika powder and garlic powder. In the middle is turmeric (20%) with a little bit saffron on top. After taking this picture I added coriander (10-15%)\n\nIf you want to recreate this keep in mind that the saffron will need to be soaked in warm/hot water and is added later to the menu you're cooking. For soaking it I normally grind it a little bit with a sprinkling of sugar and give about 50-100ml warm (nearly hot) water to it and let it rest for about 20mins.", "Forgive me if I'm wrong but shouldn't the saffron be steeped in hot water beforehand for maximum color and fragrance?", "We\u2019ve got a rich guy on our hands.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/Curry/comments/r48r0j/yellow_lentil_daal_and_naan_with_self_mixed_curry/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share", "Mh.

Tandoori chicken (about 1kilo or 2 lb)\n2. 3-4 large fresh tomatoes\n3. 3 medium-sized red onions\n4. 4 large cloves of garlic\n5. About 2 inches of a knob of ginger\n6. 2 bay leaves\n7. 1/2 tsp whole dried cloves\n8. 4cm stick of cinnamon\n9. 1/2 tsp green cardamom pods\n10. 1-2 black cardamom pods\n11. 1 tsp black peppercorns\n12. 1 tbsp of red chilli powder\n13. 1 tbsp coriander powder\n14. 1/2 tbsp turmeric powder\n15. 1 tbsp sugar\n16. 3-4 tbsp butter\n17. Salt to taste\n18. 2 tsp dried kasuri methi (fenugreek) leaves\n19. About 2 cups of water\n20. A cup of pre-soaked cashews\n21. Heavy cream or coriander or both to garnish\n22. Kewra essence/rosewater essence (this is optional but makes a world of difference)\n\nMethod: \n\n1. In a heavy bottomed pot, melt 2-3 tbsp of the butter and temper that with the bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon, cardamoms, and peppercorns. \n2. Dice the onions into smallish cubes (split one whole onion into four and you should be good for size) and start frying them in the tempered butter. \n3. About a couple minutes later, add your tomatoes (again, diced into the same size as the onions).\n4. Cook this on low heat for about 5 mins. \n5. Add in your ginger-garlic paste, salt, sugar, chilli powder, turmeric powder and coriander powder, mix well with the onions and tomatoes and cook covered on low-medium heat for another 6-7 mins or till they're nice and soft. \n6. Add in your cashews, fry with the rest for a minute, and then add water (room temperature). \n7. When it starts to bubble, turn the heat off and blend the whole thing into a thick gravy. \n8. In a separate pot, heat the remaining tbsp of butter, and half of the kasuri methi and fry for 10 secs before tipping in the gravy you just blended. \n9. Stir the kasuri methi in and then add your tandoori chicken. \n10. At this point, adjust the consistency and salt/sugar levels if you need to. \n11. Let the chicken cook in the gravy for about a minute, and then let it rest for another minute or couple. \n12. Gently mix in a few drops of kewra/rosewater. \n13. Garnish with fresh cream and cilantro and you're done! \n\nNote : this is an elaborate dish, yes, but so so worth it! Also, I make my own tandoori chicken, wrap it up in foil, stow it in the fridge the night before and then reheat it on the day of. You can obviously use tandoori from your favourite restaurant and even freshly made at that; just that I've found day-old tandoori to pack a bigger punch since it's had time to sit in its spices and is ready to take up some gravy the next day. \n\nLet me know if you need a recipe for tandoori!

A whole chicken, skinned (medium sized bird around 2lbs)\n2. 1/4 cup lemon juice\n3. 25g salt\n4. 2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste (1:1)\n5. 12g powdered black pepper\n6. 8g turmeric powder\n7. 15g coriander powder\n8. 8g cumin powder\n9. 15g chilli powder\n10. 8g garam masala powder (or add separately cinnamon powder, cardamom powder, ground cloves, mace, shahi jeera, and nutmeg) \n11. 6g chaat masala powder\n12. 6g roasted gram flour\n13. 1 cup plain yogurt \n14. 2 tbsp mustard oil\n\nMethod: \n\n1. Clean the chicken and marinate first with ingredients 2-5. \n2. Keep covered for an hour in a cool, dry place. \n3. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together ingredients 6-14. \n4. Toss the pre-marinated chicken (along with the first marinade) in this mix, coat each piece evenly, and marinate for a second time for at least 2 hours. I sometimes keep this overnight in the fridge. \n5. If you're keeping the meat on the bone, which is usually how it's done, you can either proceed to bake your chicken at 340F for 30 mins, turning the pieces over midway, OR if you have an open grill then 350-400F (gas grill, medium high) for 25-ish minutes. This also depends on the chicken itself so you need to keep checking for doneness after the first 15 minutes. If you're using a thermometer, the internal temperature should be in the 170-175F bracket for a cooked piece of chicken. \n6. If you're using boneless chicken pieces like I sometimes do you may also opt to fry them in smoking hot ghee. For this to work, you need to cut your chicken into about 6-7cm chunks and fry on high heat for 8-10 mins or till the pieces are cooked AND the spices on the outside have somewhat charred. \n\nHope you like how this turns out! :)", "Good bot", "I have to order some Chaat Masala, but I think I should have everything else.

That rice..", "Recipe for the daal: 1 onion, 3 paprika/pepper, 500ml coconut milk, 500g yellow lentils, 500ml sieved tomatoes, (self mixed) curry powder, 2 red hot chilli peppers (is what I used. You can go with more or less depends on your own taste), oil (I used sunflower oil), ginger and garlic... both depends on your own taste, I used a thumb big piece ginger. If you want, a little bit orange juice (or something similar)and lime juice.\n\n1. Prepare everything, peel the garlic and the ginger, Cut onion and pepper (the normal 3s and the chilli) in small pieces \n\n2. Heat up a big pot with a bit oil (because the lentils need a lot of water that will be added later, be sure the pot is big enough) \n\n3. Throw the onion and pepper (and the half of the chilli) in it when the oil is hot enough, let them cook until the onions are glassy  (you can put the onions alone in the pot first if you want them I little bit more toasty.) \n\n4. extinguish everything with orange juice or water (something like 300ml)\n\n5. Add a part of the curry powder (I normally use 2-3 spoonfuls here, depends on how much juice I used and how big the peppers and onion was) and let everything cook for about 10mins. Add I bit more juice/water and curry if you want. In these 10 mins add the garlic and ginger \n\n6. Add the coconut milk and the sieved tomatoes and let everything cook up one time\n\n7. Add the lentils and add 1L Water (maybe you need to use more or less water, just be sure that at this time it should look like a soup and that's okay, the lentils will soak and if you want to let it like a soup add more water later), let everything cook. The time depends on how you want the sauce and the lentils. If you wanna have a thick, creamy sauce let it cook longer (I normally let it cook 1-1,5 hours) and if you want to have everything more like a soup let it cook how its written on the package of lentils. Remember that salt will make the cook time a little bit longer, so add salt later or be sure that you test the hardness of the lentils in this case. Also add the rest of the chilli.\n\n8. Add curry, salt, pepper based on your own taste. Same goes for everything you can expect to be tasty, be creative. You can also add a little bit lime juice here but be careful, if you add too much the entire sauce will taste like it. Everytime you add something be sure to let it cook a little bit. \n\nAnd a few tipps\n-if I used too much curry I use milk to neutralize the taste (that's normally only needed if you mix you powder by yourself because the normal supermarket curry powder isn't really dominant in taste) \n\n-as I said try to use as little salt as possible before you add the lentils, sometimes I dont use salt in the entire recipe because my curry is really tast dominant and gives the whole menu a good taste so I dont really use salt (and I dont really like salt that much, but that depends on your own taste)\n\n-you can add fresh tomatoes and tomato paste if you want a more fruity flavor\n\n-you can dose the spiciness by adding the chilli in the right time. The chilli added to begin will give everything a based, mild spiciness which is a good base to start with. The chilli added later will give a bit more fruity piquancy. Also I normally use the red part of the chilli pepper and not the seeds, but the seeds will make it spicy also, just remember that the seed will make it spicier if they cook longer so be careful with them, if you add a lot of them earlier and let it cook for 2 hours the menu will be very hot :)", "i\u2019m not subscribed to this sub, this just got recommended to me but daaaaammmmnn that looks so fucking gooood i wish i could have some now i\u2019m hungry as hell", "LOOKS LIKE SUSHI RICE", "Sounds absolutely delicious", "Sorry did you say you add orange juice..??", "Its jasmine rice cooked without salt.

Salt to taste\n14. 2tbsp ghee, 3tbsp canola/groundnut/soybean oil\n15. 250g paneer\n\nMethod: \n\n1. Roast ingredients 1-4 on dry heat for about a minute and grind them into a gritty powder. \n2. Finely chop 2 of the onions and the ginger (peeled). \n3. Blend 3 of the tomatoes into a puree or used canned tomato puree, either is good. \n4. Heat some canola oil and ghee in a heavy bottomed pot (or an Indian *kadhai* if you have one, just to be more true to the original style of cooking) and lightly fry your ginger and onions till the onions turn nice and translucent but not brown. This should take around 3 mins on low heat. \n5. Stir in ingredients 9-11 and cook covered on medium heat for a couple of minutes. \n6. Pour in your pureed tomatoes, add a little salt and let that cook covered for 5-6 mins. If it gets too dry, add a tiny splash of water. This base should cook but not brown/burn. \n7. While that happens, in a separate pan fry the remaining onion, tomato, and the green pepper (either diced into big-ish chunks or sliced) in some more ghee+oil. \n8. Cut your paneer up into cubes and add that to the stir fry. \n9. Add your kashmiri chilli powder and the spices you ground in step 1 to the frying pan. Fry on medium-high heat for 2-3 mins. \n10. Then just dump this stir fry, spices, oil and all into your pot of gravy. \n11. Stir the whole thing in but gently so you don't break the paneer up but the spices are still nice and evenly mixed. \n12. Adjust the salt levels if you need to, and you're done! \n\nHope you like how this turns out :)"], "urlNames": [], "urlLink": [[], []]}

Minangkabau people were originally from West Sumatra, Indonesia, and many have travelled and migrated to Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia since 15th century. This often leads to Malaysia and Indonesia staking claims on this delicious dish, and has caused tension to both countries\u2019 bilateral relations several times.\r  \n\r  \nIndonesian culinary expert, late Bondan Winarno, once said that rendang should be understood as a \u201cpusaka bersama\u201d (shared heritage) between Indonesia and Malaysia, as historically, both countries actually were allied brothers. Plus, for centuries, Malacca Strait has been a strategic geographical area for both countries to establish relationships (political, economic, social, and cultural) with each other and various nations. It is not surprising that Malaysian and Indonesian culinary cultures are regularly shaped by foreign culinary influences from Islam (from Arabic, India, and Persia), India, China and Europe.\r  \n\r  \nThe first recorded written word of \u201crendang\u201d (referring to a goat meat), was in a Malay manuscript from the early 16th century and it is associated with the Malay word \u201cmerendang\u201d, a term for technique of slow cooking/roasting meat. When the Portuguese controlled Malacca from 1511 to 1641, Portuguese culinary influence was spread throughout the area. A distinctive legacy of Portuguese cuisine is shown by both nations' higher consumption of meat and adopting various food processing techniques. Braising meats and then finishing them by frying is one of the food preservation techniques used in Rendang.\r  \n\r  \nRendang cooking technique is eventually adopted by the Minangkabau people where Rendang is cooked with available ingredients like coconut milk, hot chillies, and various Indian spices until the sauce seeps into the meat, and the texture of the meat becomes dried and blackish. This preserves the dish and makes it durable without having to be stored in a cooler and does not have to always be reheated/refried frequently.\r  \n\r  \nThis preservation technique is important to the Minangkabau people because one of their prominent cultures is the wandering culture or \u201cmerantau\u201d, where men are encouraged to move away to gain life experience and earn their fortune. Since 15th century, Negeri Sembilan has been a wandering and migration destination of Minangkabau people, which means that durable travel food like Rendang also crossed back and forth between two nations. Many of Minangkabau descendents settled in Negeri Sembilan, where they inherited Mingkabau cultures from their ancestors. Through all these influences of exchanging cultures, the geographical origin of modern day Rendang becomes blurred.\r  \n\r  \nThe meat used in Rendang is usually beef, but chicken, goat, buffalo, or even porcupine meat are used too. The herbs and spices used are turmeric leaves, galangal, ginger, garlic, lemongrass, chillies, shallots and more. These ingredients will not only preserve the meat, but also add punchy and complex flavours. The meat is then cooked in coconut milk and shredded coconut for hours using low heat until all the moisture evaporates and the meat becomes tender and turned dark brown from the absorption of the spicy sauce. The process actually changes from boiling to stewing to frying when the coconut milk eventually turned into coconut oil.\r  \n\r  \nTo make a good traditional dish of Rendang, patience is required because it is very time-consuming and involves pounding and grinding the herbs and spices. Great amount of care is required too, for continuously stirring and churning the ingredients in the pot, all the while preventing it from getting burnt. Traditionally, the dish is cooked for between three and seven hours over a low heat on a wood fire. It can last for more than three weeks if cooked properly.\r  \n\r  \nRendang is best served with steamed rice, nasi lemak, ketupat, lemang, or just about anything, really. Although Rendang is traditionally served during festive seasons or special occasions to honour guests, it can be easily found in Malaysian (and Indonesian) restaurants throughout Malaysia and overseas.", "One of the greatest dishes on earth."], "urlNames": [], "urlLink": [[], []]}

You can marinate it up to a full day if you want to prep before hand, but I\u2019ve found that marinating it while you prep the gravy is good enough. \n\nGravy: heat oil in a pot, throw in 5 medium sized red onions and let them caramelise. Once browned, throw in garlic/ginger and chilli paste, saut\u00e9 until fragrant, then spices: cardamom powder, cumin powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, salt and black pepper powder, garam masala. Fry until fragrant. Next add 5-6 diced tomatoes and let them cook on a simmer for about 15 mins until the oil starts to separate from the masala. Of course, you should stir while this is happening. Once the oil has separated, let it cool down. Once it\u2019s cooled, chuck it all into a blender and blend until the gravy is smooth. \n\nWhile gravy is cooling, you can prepare your veggies.

It is made from a thin batter of various fermented pulses (legumes) and rice flour, which is then cooked on a flat griddle. The dish is usually eaten during breakfast and dinner with accompaniments such as curry, chutney, and dhaal.\r  \n\r  \nThosai originated from South India, where it was called dosa, dosai or dosay. Much of Malaysian Indian cuisine is predominantly South Indian-inspired in character and taste, because the vast majority of Malaysia's Indian community are of South Indian descent.\r  \n\r  \nThis Indian pancake is made of various fermented pulses including dhal beans, rice flour and halba (Malay for fenugreek). The process of making Thosai begins with soaking the urad dhal (black gram) and fenugreek for six hours in water. The ingredients are then drained before cooked rice and water are added to the mix and blended to a very smooth texture. Traditionally, the mixture is ground using a stone grinder, as it is believed that this results in a smoother Thosai. Next, rice flour and salt are added to the mixture and stirred to form a lump-free batter, which is then left for at least 12 hours to ferment. It is generally prepared the night before due to the long fermentation time needed.\r  \n\r  \nTo cook the Thosai, a ladleful of the fermented batter is spooned onto the center of a heated flat griddle coated with oil. The batter is then quickly spread out from the center of the griddle in a circular motion using the base of the ladle. When the batter develops little holes and its underside turns golden brown, it is flipped over. Once cooked, Thosai either rolled up to create a tube or fold into a triangle. At most Mamak restaurants, it is usually served with curries, chutneys, or a dhaal (lentil curry). Chutneys are made from coconut, chilli, mint, or peanut.\r  \n\r  \nThere are many different versions of Thosai depending on size, content, and cooking method. The most common Thosai is Masala Thosai. Masala is the Indian word used to describe any spices mixture. Masala Thosai consists of a mixture of flour and potato filling that is heavily spiced with sliced onions, chillies, mustard seeds and cumin seeds, giving it a yellowish colour.\r  \n\r  \nPaper Thosai is a large, crisp, paper-thin version of regular Thosai. A batter of fermented ground rice and urad dhal is cooked until crisp so that more of the batter is allowed to caramelise. The dish has a unique nutty flavour resulting from the sweet-and-sour taste of the caramelised fermented batter. With a diameter of about half a meter, Paper Thosai is roughly twice the size of standard Thosai and served in a cone shape. This version of Thosai is more popular with the Chinese community.\r  \n\r  \nRava/Rawa Thosai differs from normal Thosai as it is made using semolina flour which has a nutty flavour, and it need not be fermented overnight. Cumin seeds, onions and chillies are added to spice up the batter. It has a lighter texture and appears browner.\r  \n\r  \nEgg Thosai is simply an addition of egg that is scrambled on top of cooking batter to create a fluffier version of Thosai. Furthermore, there is Onion Thosai which gives the dish a sharp flavour and rough texture as the onion is only partially cooked. And then there is an influx of modern creative Thosai, like Cheese Thosai, or Milo Thosai, or Banana Nutella Thosai.", "This looks mind-blowingly delicious.", "Wow its called thosai?We in south india call it dosa(pronouched as dosha).", "Yeah it slowly turned into thosai when it came to Malaysia =D", "Nobody calls it 'dosha'.", "sometimes in telugu we say it like do-say", "Same in Sri Lanka \ud83d\ude0a", "Maybe not in other south indian states.

I can send you a few recipes but except for the chicken curry, most of these are not the ones I followed for the pic above (as I followed original Sinhalese language youtube recipes). They should still do the trick though :) \n\nBeetroot:  [https://www.islandsmile.org/beetroot-curry-kid-friendly/](https://www.islandsmile.org/beetroot-curry-kid-friendly/) \n\nDhal:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4T4qsJL\\_jY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4T4qsJL_jY) \n\nLeafy coconut salad:  [http://www.lotusartichoke.com/arugula-mallum/](http://www.lotusartichoke.com/arugula-mallum/) \n\nChicken curry:  \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* Around 1kg of skinless bone-in chicken (I used 3 chicken legs that I cut up into smaller pieces)\n* 7-8 garlic cloves (I used a whole bulb.... \\^\\^) and a big piece of ginger (4cm maybe?), ground into a paste or finely chopped\n* 7 cardamoms and 6 cloves, crushed\n* 1 big onion, chopped\n* 2 stalks of lemongrass, halved lengthwise\n* 2 TBSP of chilli powder\n* 2 TBSP of curry powder (\\*if you want to make your own, this is the recipe for around 140g of curry powder: lightly toast 1 cup of coriander seeds with half a cup of cumin seeds, then set aside. In the same pan, toast 1 TSP of cloves, 1 TSP of cardamom, 1 1/2 pieces of star anise, 1 and 1/4 TBSP black peppercorns and a big stick of cinnamon (around 4 inches). Transfer everything into a spice blender and blend. Et voil\u00e0. Alternatively just get store-bought curry powder that lists similar ingredients.\\*)\n* 1 TSP of turmeric powder\n* 1 big pandan leaf (roughly cut into smaller pieces)\n* 1 sprig of curry leaves (I didn't have fresh leaves, so I used dry ones)\n* 1 1/2 TSP of salt (or to taste)\n* Tamarind (if you're using fresh, around the size of a small lime, you can leave the seeds in); if you don't have tamarind, you can use anything that is acidic in nature (lime juice, lemon juice, vinegar, etc. - just be careful not to add too much at first, you can always adjust acidity later on when tasting the curry)\n* 2 TBSP of neutral oil (sunflower, rapseed, coconut, etc.)\n* around 1 cup of THIN coconut milk (if you use store-bought milk, you'll have to dilute it with water significantly; I think I used about 1/4 cup thick coconut milk from the store and filled the rest up with water)\n\n**Method**\n\nMarinate the chicken pieces with salt, turmeric, chilli powder, curry powder and tamarind and set aside for a few minutes while you prepare the other ingredients.\n\nHeat oil in a pot or deep pan over low-medium heat. Add in pandan leaf, curry leaves, chopped onion and chopped ginger-garlic paste. Fry for a minute, then add crushed cardamoms and cloves, stir well. When onions are soft and translucent, add in marinated chicken and lemongrass. Mix well. Slightly increase heat and add a bit of water (around 1/4 cup), stir well and cover the pot. Cook for 15 minutes.\n\nThen give it a good stir, cover again and cook for another 5 minutes. Add in coconut milk but do not cover the pot again once coconut milk is added. Simmer for another 10 minutes under low heat. Taste for salt and acidity and add more if needed.\n\nTurn off heat, cover again and let it sit for a few minutes. When you take off the lid again, the oil should be sitting at the top and the curry should have turned a nice reddish color. You can pick out all the less edible ingredients (lemongrass, curry leaves, pandan leaf) at this stage and then serve.", "Thank you kindly for the recipe share! \ud83d\ude0a", "Thanks, I really appreciate that.", "holy crap you came through! ahh im so excited to try some of these,, thankyou!", "\ud83d\ude02 Hope they turn out good"], "urlNames": ["Pineapple curry : Sri Lanka Recipes : Malini's Kitchen", {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, "The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Recipes from World Adventures"], "urlLink": [[], [], [], [], ["http://www.infolanka.com/recipes/mess3/84.html"], ["https://www.islandsmile.org/"], ["https://www.islandsmile.org/beetroot-curry-kid-friendly/](https://www.islandsmile.org/beetroot-curry-kid-friendly/)", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4T4qsJL\\_jY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4T4qsJL_jY)", "http://www.lotusartichoke.com/arugula-mallum/](http://www.lotusartichoke.com/arugula-mallum/)"], [], [], [], []]}

Asian markets might sell loose cuttlebone pieces, but to be completely fair, it's okay to leave this out of the spice mix OR if you're near the ocean and feeling energetic, collect the seawater from rock craters (avoiding anything that's obviously polluted), boil the water off and make your own seasalt.", "agreeeee", "Sounds perfect!

In the same pan, toast 1 TSP of cloves, 1 TSP of cardamom, 1 1/2 pieces of star anise, 1 and 1/4 TBSP black peppercorns and a big stick of cinnamon (around 4 inches). Transfer everything into a spice blender and blend. Et voil\u00e0. Alternatively just get store-bought curry powder that lists similar ingredients.\\*) \n* 1 TSP of turmeric powder\n* 1 big pandan leaf (roughly cut into smaller pieces)\n* 1 sprig of curry leaves (I didn't have fresh leaves, so I used dry ones) \n* 1 1/2 TSP of salt (or to taste) \n* Tamarind (if you're using fresh, around the size of a small lime, you can leave the seeds in); if you don't have tamarind, you can use anything that is acidic in nature (lime juice, lemon juice, vinegar, etc. - just be careful not to add too much at first, you can always adjust acidity later on when tasting the curry) \n* 2 TBSP of neutral oil (sunflower, rapseed, coconut, etc.)\n* around 1 cup of THIN coconut milk (if you use store-bought milk, you'll have to dilute it  with water significantly; I think I used about 1/4 cup thick coconut milk from the store and filled the rest up with water) \n\n**Method**\n\nMarinate the chicken pieces with salt, turmeric, chilli powder, curry powder and tamarind and set aside for a few minutes while you prepare the other ingredients. \n\nHeat oil in a pot or deep pan over low-medium heat. Add in pandan leaf, curry leaves, chopped onion and chopped ginger-garlic paste. Fry for a minute, then add crushed cardamoms and cloves, stir well. When onions are soft and translucent, add in marinated chicken and lemongrass. Mix well. Slightly increase heat and add a bit of water (around 1/4 cup), stir well and cover the pot. Cook for 15 minutes. \n\nThen give it a good stir, cover again and cook for another 5 minutes. Add in coconut milk but do not cover the pot again once coconut milk is added. Simmer for another 10 minutes under low heat. Taste for salt and acidity and add more if needed. \n\nTurn off heat, cover again and let it sit for a few minutes.

Take about 1/3 portion of a half coconut. Add 1 tsp poppy seeds to it. Now grind to coarse texture without adding water. Then add about 1/4 cup water and grind to a very fine paste \n2.\tTake a pan, add 2 tbsp oil; After it heats partially add whole spices, coriander seeds, pepper, cumin and Saunf. Saut\u00e9 30 sec at medium flame. Then add about 15 shallots roughly sliced and saut\u00e9 until it turns slightly golden for about 5 mins at medium flame. Then add 8nos. dried red chilli and saut\u00e9 another 30-sec medium flame and turn off the heat. Now let it cool down to room temperature.\n3.\tTransfer the saut\u00e9ed spices and onion to a mixer jar. First coarse grind the contents. Finally, add about 1/4 cup water and grind to about 90% or to fine consistency as your choice.\n4.\tNow take a mud vessel or hard-bottomed Kadai or degi of your choice. To get the authentic village flavour prefer to use a mud vessel.\n5.\tAdd 1/4 cup oil to it.\n6.\tAfter the oil heats up add about 10 roughly sliced shallots(1/2 cup), salt and one medium size big onion ( 1/2 cup) and saut\u00e9 it until deep-fried at high flame. This takes about 12 minutes at high flame.\n7.\tNow add 2 tsp ginger garlic paste to it also saut\u00e9 it for 2 mins at medium flame until it turns aromatic and the raw smell goes off.\n8.\tFinally add the finely chopped tomatoes. Cover and cook for 5 mins at medium flame until tomatoes turn mushy.\n9.\tTo this add the masala paste made earlier; Saut\u00e9 this for about 5-7 mins until the raw masala smell disappears and the dish starts turning aromatic.\n10.\tNow add the mutton pieces and sear evenly at medium flame for about 5 mins.\n11.\tNow add about 3 cups water and salt as required. Once it comes to boil. Turn flame to low and cover and cook for about 40 mins at low flame. At this stage, the meat is nearly cooked 90%.\n12.\tAfter 40 mins, open the lid. Add the tomato paste and add about 1-2 cups water as per required consistency and again close and cook for another 10 mins on a low flame.\n13.\tFinally add the thali to the mutton curry for the curry releasing all its awesome flavour.\n14.\tThis is one of the best curries you will absolutely love after trying. The taste is just so perfect with both rice and roti.

I really wonder what Skiz could possibily be short for, haha.", "Here you go: [https://breadbrothandbrieyond.wordpress.com/2019/07/28/claypot-crab-curry/](https://breadbrothandbrieyond.wordpress.com/2019/07/28/claypot-crab-curry/)\n\nI just tweaked it a tiny bit: \n\nIngredients \n\n* 4 blue swimmer crabs \u2013 cleaned, prepped and washed\n* 1 1/2 tsp salt + 1 1/2 cracked pepper\n* 1 tsp turmeric\n* 1 tsp unroasted curry powder\n* 1 tbsp Jaffna curry powder \n* 3-4 tsp chilli powder\n* 3 large tomatoes, diced\n* 4 inch piece lemongrass\n* 1 sprig of curry leaves\n* 1 piece of pandan leaf (1 inch)\n* 3cm piece of ginger, pounded finely\n* 3 tbs of tamarind water\n* 3-4 cloves of garlic\n* 1 red onion chopped finely\n* 2 green chillies, chopped\n* 1 cup thin coconut milk\n* 1/2 cup thick coconut milk\n* 6-8 fenugreek seeds\n* 1 inch piece Sri Lankan cinnamon\n* Handful of Moringa leaves (optional)\n* Oil for frying\n\nMethod\n\nHeat 1-2 tbs of oil (I use coconut) in a deep, heavy bottom pan or a large clay pot. Once the oil is hot, add in all the ingredients except the tomato, tamarind, crabs, coconut milk and Moringa leaves\n\nWhen the aromats have started releasing their scents into the oil, add in the tomatoes and stir until they begin to soften. At this stage, add in the thin coconut milk and and tamarind. Let this cook for steep for about 5 minutes\n\nAdd in the crabs to the sauce and cover with a lid. There should be enough coconut milk to cover the crabs half way. If there isn\u2019t enough liquid to partially cover the crabs, add some more water or thin coconut milk. Cook this on a high flame for about 10-15 minutes until the crabs have changed colour.\n\nAt this stage, remove the lid and continue to cook until the sauce has reduced and become very dark in colour\n\nAt this stage, add in the thick coconut milk and simmer the crabs for a further 5 minutes or so or until the curry sauce is at your desired consistency. I don\u2019t like mine to be too thick so I don\u2019t thicken the sauce much. Also be aware that it\u2019s very easy to overcook the crab meat so if you choose to cook the curry any further, depending on the freshness of your crab, the meat may end up a little tough.\n\nIf you are using Moringa leaves, take the crabs off the heat and then sprinkle them on top.", " Sorry it took me a spell, I had loaned my copy of the book out.

Salt and sugar to taste\n17. 1 cup of water\n\nMethod: \n\n1. Cut your paneer into cubes and toss them in some salt and turmeric powder. \n2. Heat mustard oil in a pot and fry the paneer cubes on medium-high heat for about a minute on either side. \n3. Take the paneer off the heat and save them for later. \n4. To the remaining oil add 1 tbsp ghee and temper that with ingredients 5-9. \n5. Dice your tomato up into smallish (about 3cm) cubes and fry them with a touch of salt (to help them cook faster) on medium heat for 2 mins. \n6. Add in your grated ginger, sliced green/red chillies, turmeric powder, coriander powder, and *half* of the shahi garam masala powder. Fry on medium heat for a minute, and then lower heat and cook covered for another minute or so. \n7. While that's happening, mash up a few of your blanched peas and then add that to your pot. \n8. Next drop in the rest of your peas and cook with the spices for 2 minutes on low heat. \n9. Add your water and let the whole thing come to a gentle rolling boil. \n10. Adjust your salt and sugar levels at this point. \n11. Throw in the fried paneer cubes and wait for the oil to start floating up to the surface. \n12. Mix the rest of your shahi garam masala with the remaining tbsp of ghee, turn the heat off, and drizzle that ghee over the top. \n13. Cover your pot and let it rest for 5 mins before serving. \n\nNote: I prefer this a little dry and served with whole wheat rotis.

{"id": "11qfo1p", "title": "American Southerner experimenting with curry. Anyone got any tips?", "body": "So a couple weeks ago we had taco night.  I usually mix our taco seasoning rather than buy the premixed stuff.  For some reason I decided I could have fun subbing garam masala and turmeric in and having a kind of \"curry\" adjacent taco night.  Since then I got on a curry kick.  Twice now I've started from the bottom with onions and garlic in a pan with various seasonings: turmeric, garam masala, ginger, clove, coriander, chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, and mustard seeds are my usual suspects.  \n\nTonight I actually planned ahead and got fresh ginger to cook with the onion and garlic.  Then I'm going to toss in some diced tomato and tomato paste to cook down into a sauce and finish with a heavy cream.  Then I'll be finishing some basic noodles in the sauce.  I did forget to get ghee (again).  So given all that, and the spices I mentioned above, can anyone make some recommendations or does anyone have some tips?  I think I'll probably go to the store top grab some ghee, but if I don't make it, can anyone recommend a good substitute?\n\nOh!  And I'm out of garam masala, and so is the store.  :(\n\nEDIT:  Here's the [follow-up](https://imgur.com/gallery/vbOYZ3W).  I tried a home made garam mix.  But wasn't really sure when to add it?  Before the separation or after?  In either case I forgot to add it until after I added the cream, peas, and noodles.  That means it didn't really get cooked at all.  All I could smell the whole time eating was cinnamon.  But it didn't taste overwhelmingly of cinnamon.", "username": "bjeebus", "upvotes": 35, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Curry/comments/11qfo1p/american_southerner_experimenting_with_curry/", "permalink": "/r/Curry/comments/11qfo1p/american_southerner_experimenting_with_curry/", "comments": ["The biggest tip I ever got off this sub is to cook the onions slowly with little bits of water now and then for a lot longer than you think! I usually cook them 30-45 mins now in butter, oil, and sometimes tomato puree or even celery too and the taste is a game changer.\n\nIt's all about the onions my dude!", "You can make your own ghee at home. It's essentially just clarified butter that's cooked low and slow for 30ish minutes. Take a good amount of regular butter, put it in a small pot on low. Once it starts to sputter and foam, skin off the top and keep doing this till it's clear, then strain through cheese cloth (or not, if you don't mind some milk solids) and bam. You're done. \n\nIf it browns you've eithered cooked it too hot or too long, though that can be good in of itself.", "If you don't have an India/Pakistani grocery store nearby, you can order fenugreek and other spices from Amazon.  Fenugreek is a great spice leaf that makes a difference in a lot of northern Indian food.\n\nClassic butter chicken/chicken tikka masala are great dishes to master.  More popular in the US and UK than in India, but kids and newbies to Indian food tend to really love them.\n\nChicken biryani a baked rice dish is also a great one to make.  Lots of good YouTube videos for them.  Don't skimp on well browned onions.\n\nGhee is for cooking, it has a high smoke point but aside from a maybe a nutty flavor it doesn't add a ton of flavor in my opinion.  (I still use it, store bought or make at home.)  Regular butter is used it significant quantities in a lot of Indian food, so use that as well.  (It just burns at higher temps.)", "I feel this! Fresh garlic and ginger are indispensable, but doing a lot of prep is hard for us so we get the bottle/jar of minced garlic and use a brand of frozen shredded ginger that comes in convenient teaspoon-ish cubes. Don't let anyone shame you for not always using fresh because the difference between the jar and fresh isn't going to be noticeable in the end. But, using some fresh minced garlic along with some of the paste brings it up a notch - I usually add some in with the veg. \n\nI think the best you can do is just experiment and learn about curry as you go. Do you prefer a Thai curry? Massaman? The distinctions aren't as important as making something you like, but knowing the differences and being able to implement them in your dishes helps to get you where you're trying to go. For example, lemongrass is great in Thai dishes but doesn't quite go with a dish like aloo Gobi. Likewise I make a different curry for chickpeas than I do for tofu or paneer. And I've made some that were too hot or not very good. \n\nAnother thing I'd recommend is getting a mortar and pestle, and toasting your spices - cumin, coriander, black pepper, cloves, etc - and then grinding them yourself. But this isn't always practical for everyone, and there's nothing wrong with using ground cumin, etc from the bottle. But toasting and grinding them yourself gives you more variety and control. I do it when I'm able to but admittedly that's not very often these days.\n\nI like to make a paste with my toasted spices, salt, chili, garlic and ginger, and I usually get two dishes out of each \"batch\" of it. I start my onions saut\u00e9ing in oil or butter and cook my paste into it, add my veggies, tofu etc then add coconut milk to desired soupiness. And just simmer til done.\n\nThe youtube channel Curries with Bumbi has a lot of good, easy to follow recipes as well.\n\nOh and don't be afraid to add sweetness, or a little vinegar, or use things like soy sauce to add salt. The best curry I've ever made (imo) had soy sauce and date syrup. \n\nAlso I love finding curry packets/mixes and trying them. I've liked some of them way more than others, but every one has helped me to identify what I do or don't like in my own cooking.\n\nEdit: my dishes usually go - saute onions with salt in butter or oil, add spice paste, add and saute veg, then add in the liquid and whatever spices are needed at that point. I try to make it where the aromatics and spices can cook into a kinda base that I can then sorta stir-fry with", "Hi, also an American Southerner here! I love to make Daal. It\u2019s essentially a spiced lentil stew. Can come together very quickly, the possibilities for flavor combos are endless and it\u2019s cheap and filling to make. I follow an Instagram account called rootedinspice that shares some really great Indian recipes.", "The quickest sub for ghee is brown butter. For garam masala i would use cinnamon, nutmeg and pepper - ymmv. It looks like you're figured out that you add it towards the end of the cook but I'm from the south and ve barely use it for our dishes. Have fun.", "The biggest misconception people have about Indian curries is that they think curries are spice curries or tomato curries or cream curries. They're none of these.\n\nIndian curries are onion curries. The incredibly deep and savory base flavor you get is 90% because of onions with ginger-garlic playing a supporting role.\n\nIn fact, I don't even use garam masala - it is honestly not needed for a vast majority of Indian dishes. But that's not to say it is bad either.\n\nHere's what I do. I follow a recipe but i triple the quantity of onions and garlic and fine dice them and cook them low and slow with lots of oil for over 30-40 minutes. You want the onions to turn deep dark brown but not black. Towards the last 10 minutes of the onions cooking, add a cup of more onions. These will become translucent and will be more for texture and flavor while the caramelized onions will act more as a flavor base.\n\nNow follow the recipe. In terms of spices, I stick to the basics: turmeric powder, Kashmiri chili powder or paprika or Mexican chili powder, coriander powder, and cumin powder (half the quantity of coriander powder). That's it.\n\nAnd yes, I finish most curries with a tablespoon of dried fenugreek leaves that i crush in my hand before adding. Think of it as oregano - it even smells similar but is a lot more savory and \"curry-like\". Fenugreek is a magical ingredient.\n\nAnd i always finish the dish with lots of chopped cilantro and a big knob of butter and a generous squeeze of lime juice or lemon juice to balance the flavor.", "[How to cook every Indian dish ever](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=U4zVQxPJmnY)\n\nMost Indian noodle dishes are indo-Chinese (Indian spices with soy sauce, vinegar, and Chinese sauces).

If you cook it too long its going to loose all the aroma and flavor, which is the point of the mix.  You have a big bag and most recipes recommend using 2 teaspoons MAX.  Kinda sucks.  So I have a few recommendations.  One, add it to marinades.  ANY meat marinade.  You will start to taste and smell and it's a good starting point.  Next, use it anytime you make a sauce.  Italian tomato sauce?  Put a little bit at the end.  You can also add it to sauces that don't take a long time to cook.  Any sort of pan sauce?  Use Garam Masala as your spice mix.  Sub it for taco seasoning.  Just remember, most of these spices are fat soluble so throwing it in Ramen won't really work unless you add some oil to the mix.  You can add it to oil based Salad dressings or mayonnaise for sandwiches.   Any curry recipe (Indian, Thai, japanese...) can use a pick me up from Garam Masala.  Just remember not to cook it at too high heat, not for too long, and in some fat.  Side note: Garam Masalas are not GREAT already powdered.  Ideally you would roast whole spices and grind it yourself.  This is probably a few years old and will only keep getting older.

The flavor is excellent and it's simple to use. Would be great for camping. You could bring a bag of diced onions, peanuts and sweet potato and essentially just stew it in a stock made from the paste, canned coconut milk, and vegetable broth or water. Or saute some onion and tofu and then stock that and stew peppers or really any vegetable you'd like.\n\nEdit: my favorite is the massaman, but they are all pretty good and I think you can buy 14 oz cans which would be enough to make a batch for at least 10 people!", "Japanese curry blocks are super easy. Plus the rest of the ingredients are generally dry; potatoes, carrots, onion, fuji apple, honey, etc.\n\nThe basic recipe is on the curry block instructions but here is another guide you might find useful:\n\n[https://sudachirecipes.com/japanese-curry-roux-cubes/](https://sudachirecipes.com/japanese-curry-roux-cubes/)\n\nI know S&B makes some vegetarian roux blocks not sure if they are also vegan.  \n\n\nEdit: I'd also check out Indian curries; lots of them can easily be vegan like chana masala (chickpeas in a tomato sauce) and Masoor Dal (red lentil curry)", "I'm doing this for a group of 9 currently. Cooked a vegetarian Thai red curry with eggplant, and have chicken marinating now. Chicken will be cooked and frozen separately. Rice will be cooked and frozen separately. The plan is to try to keep everything frozen, warm up the rice and curry together in a large pot and the chicken separately. Then anyone can add chicken if they want, or have a vegetarian meal.\n\n\n Hopefully it works out, still a few days off from starting the trip.", "Second vote for lentil/pulse curries, you can always include carrots/potatoes/whatever you carry. \n\nYummly has a bunch of recipes with a dhal search.", "Cooking for 40 people is no joke in a normal home kitchen, let alone a camping trip kitchen.  I have a big home kitchen and outdoor bbq kitchen, and cooking for 15 people and getting enough food ready at once isn't easy.\n\nThe first thing you should look at is scale.  Do you have the ability cook that quantity of liquid on your camp stove?  (Can it hold a pot with maybe 20lbs of food?  Do you have a pot that can hold that much food?  A smaller stove that uses one of those green cans probably can't boil that much liquid.)\n\nThe second thing to look at is what can you bring already pre-made?  You won't be able to make rice for 40 people easily on a camp stove.  Can you prep onions & veggies at home and keep in a cooler?  Cutting veggies for 40 people in a kitchen is a long process, balanced on a stump or wobbly table is going to be hard.\n\nA Chana masala (chick pea curry) with rice is probably going to be the easiest.  You'll just need a lot of cans of chickpeas because you won't have time or the ability to cook them dried.  Served with rice it's pretty yummy and very scalable.\n\nA potential option that might be easier are something called Singapore noodles.  They are a curry noodle that are a staple in Hong Kong and many Cantonese kitchens (not in Singapore oddly enough.). And they are crazy filling/carb dense for a camping trip.  The noodles are soaked in water instead of boiled, and then fried up with a handful of ingredients and toppings.  (And curry powder.)  Easy to make in batches, cook the vegetarian dishes first and then switch to non-veg if you want.", "Do it BIR style.\n\nMake your base gravy and just tart it up with other spices/veg/meat. \n\nDoesn't need to be spicy but should be well spiced.\n\n40 people is going to require a pretty serious set up though.", "Indian weddings often cater for 1,500+ people they usally have aubergine (eggplant) curry and rice.", "Big fan of Mama Lam's curry paste.

If you guys end up using the recipes, I demand pics though ;)", "**Black Chicken Curry (spicy!)** \n\n**Ingredients** \n\n\\*Around 700g of skinless bone-in chicken pieces (I bought whole chicken legs and cut each leg into 5 pieces but a whole chicken cut into smaller pieces would be even better)   \n\\*2 TBSP of raw chillie powder   \n\\*1/2 TSP of Turmeric powder  \n\\*1/2 TSP of Ground Black Pepper  \n\\*10 Tamarind Seeds (or around 1 TBSP Tamarind Paste)  \n\\*Handful of Curry leaves, finely sliced  \n\\*1 1/2 big Pandan leaves   \n\\*4 cardamom pods, crushed  \n\\*4 cloves, crushed  \n\\*8 garlic cloves & 1 inch piece of ginger, ground into a paste or finely chopped  \n\\*1 bunch of fresh coriander (you can use the thin stems too)  \n\\*1 red onion, chopped  \n\\*water  \n\\*1 tsp salt (to taste)   \n\\*3 TBSP of chicken curry powder (\\*\\*\\*if you want to make your own, this is the recipe for around 140g of curry powder: lightly toast 1 cup of coriander seeds with half a cup of cumin seeds, then set aside. In the same pan, toast 1 TSP of cloves, 1 TSP of cardamom, 1 1/2 pieces of star anise, 1 and 1/4 TBSP black peppercorns and a big stick of cinnamon (around 4 inches). Transfer everything into a spice blender and blend. Et voil\u00e0. Alternatively just get store-bough curry powder that lists similar ingredients.\\*\\*\\*)   \n\n\n**Method**  \n\n\nHeat a pan over low-medium heat. Once the pan is hot, add the raw chillie powder and gradually roast until it takes on a very dark red / brown color (do not skip this step - this is the key to getting that beautiful dark color in your curry). Now marinate the chicken with this roasted chillie powder, turmeric, tamarind seeds, salt and curry powder for a few minutes. Mix it with your hands (but wear gloves if your hands are on the sensitive side or just mix thoroughly with a spoon).\n\nHeat around 2 TBSP of vegetable oil in a non-stick pot or pan over medium heat. Add crushed cloves and cardamom. Then add ginger garlic paste, chopped onions and sliced curry leaves. Fry for a few minutes till the onions soften and you smell the aroma from the spices. Add the crushed pepper. \n\nAdd half a cup of water to the bowl in which your chicken is marinating and add the content of the bowl to the pot with the fried onions. Stir well. Cover, reduce heat to low-medium and cook for 10 minutes. \n\nAfter 10 minutes open the lid, add pandan leaves, fresh coriander, and another 1 or 1 1/2 cups of water. Stir well. Now cover, increase heat to medium-high heat and cook for another 8 minutes. \n\nThat's basically it - at the end you should taste and adjust for salt and/or \"acidity\" - I felt that my curry needed to be a bit more tangy, so I added a splash of lime juice. But this depends entirely on the amount and quality of tamarind you used.  \n\nI know a lot of these ingredients are probably not common in non-SE-Asian-households but they're great investments if you like this kind of food. :)", "Thank you! - what about the red rice and potatoes? - it all just looks good and I want to copy it!", "Great thanks", "Coming up!

Place into a saucepan or pot, add fenugreek seeds, curry leaves, onions and pandan leaf. Add Water to \\*just\\* cover the potatoes (but not fully). Cover and cook at medium heat for around 10 minutes.  \n\nRemove lid, add curry powder, turmeric and chili powder. Reduce heat a bit, add cinnamon stick, mix well and cover again. Cook for another 4 to 5 minutes. \n\nLift the lid again and lastly add coconut milk and green chillies (I slit mine along the middle). Season with salt, bring to boil and then turn off heat but keep on stove for another 5 minutes. \n\nIf the curry and pandan leaves are too hard to get, just leave them out. The fenugreek seeds and the curry powder are also no must. If you ask me, the curry tastes good even with just the potatoes, salt, turmeric and coconut milk - those are the bare essential ingredients.", "**Arugula-coconut salad** (or arugula \"sambol\" as I like to call it because I added raw green chillies here as well :)) \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n\\*around 100g of arugula / rocket   \n**\\***around 1/3 cup of \"fresh\" scraped coconut (I used frozen coconut from the Asian store, this might also work with desiccated coconut that was soaked in coconut milk)   \n\\*6-8 cherry tomatoes   \n\\*1 small red onion, finely diced  \n\\*1-2 green chillies, chopped (optional)   \n\\*lime juice to taste (I used about 2-3 TBSP)  \n\\*Salt and pepper to taste \n\n**Method**\n\nThis one's really easy: Roughly chop the arugula.

{"id": "3bqugf", "title": "New Management", "body": "Hey! Just thought I'd make a quick post introducing myself as the new moderator of /r/Curry. \n\nI've been subscribed here for something like 2 years now. I've pretty much exclusively lurked here, but now that I've got mod status, I'll definitely make an effort to be more of an active contributor to this sub. This is the first sub I've modded... to be honest, I never really had any desire to mod anything, but the /r/NBA invasion was destroying what had always been a quiet, pleasant sub. I figured I had to try to do something about it, and I'm on reddit several times a day anyways, so I applied on /r/RedditRequest. The admins apparently agreed with me, so here we are.\n\nAs you can see, I've purged all of the invasion posts. After thinking about it a bit, I haven't banned anybody for the time being. I've got a (maybe foolish) hope that maybe at least one person from /r/NBA will become a regular, on-topic poster here. Maybe not, but I'm going to err on the side of not slinging around the banhammer. Subsequent off-topic posts will be removed as quickly as I can, and repeat offenders will be banned. Note that this includes posts that try to subtly reference Stephen Curry in a roundabout way - I'm not stupid, I watch sports too, I'm perfectly capable of noticing jokes like \"The MVP of spices\". I'll try to keep an eye on everything, but please feel free to make use of the report button if you see anything referencing the invasion.\n\nI've put up a couple rules in the sidebar. I think they're all very common-sense and not very intrusive, I don't think anybody that's here to have a discussion about cooking has anything to worry about.

I'm not fundamentally opposed to the idea, but I'm honestly not convinced that it's necessary. Player subs are very uncommon in my experience, I really question how often people come here genuinely looking for discussion of the player. The invasion was an invasion, there was no confusion. \n\nAlso, \"the more well-known Curry\", really? Very funny. A billion or so Indians probably disagree. The world outside of American basketball fans exists.\n\nSecond: I banned hate speech because the rules I put into place are intended to be comprehensive. Off the cuff, I disagree with your assessment that there are other types of objectively \"bad posts\" that I missed. The on-topic rule is very sweeping, and I think takes care of the vast majority of it. I agree that I don't anticipate actually having to enforce rule 2 in the forseeable future, but as I said, rules are intended to be comprehensive.", "Well, somebody could post gay porn where they use curry as an anal lubricant and then eat it afterward. That would be on topic and civil, but still clearly not allowed.

Because this sub has had no problems with hate speech that I'm aware of.", "I seriously doubt that exists. And no, I'd consider porn to be off-topic even if there was mention of curry in it. The primary point of that would be porn, not curry. You're stretching for examples, and it seems to me that's  because my rules are pretty much comprehensive.\n\nI don't care if people post hateful things on subs dedicated to it (I was very much against the banning of FPH, for instance), but this is a sub about cooking, for Christ's sake. A rule titled \"Keep it civil\" is very much appropriate.", "[deleted]", "Three rules, one of which is why the admins decided this sub needed an active mod, another that is simply a link to reddit-wide rules, a third that's pretty much ubiquitous amongst a vast majority of subs. I really don't think that constitutes a power trip, and so far, it seems like you're the only subscriber that does.\n\nEspecially given your remark of \"the better-known Curry\", I think you're an r/NBA subscriber trying to stir the pot. Your opinions are noted, but I don't find them persuasive, and unfortunately, I have the final call. \n\nAnd I don't think somebody on a power trip sits and exchanges frank opinions with dissenters, so maybe chill out a bit and realize I just have a slightly different outlook on how to manage this sub moving forward."], "urlNames": [], "urlLink": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]}

{"id": "p0ynt", "title": "Typical South Indian everyday home curry", "body": "Ready for some legit curry South Indian style? Well its not that hard to be honest so throw out your Pataks curry in a hurry kit, because its probably some poor kids diarrhea (at least it tastes that way, and I'm pretty sure they water it down to cut down on costs). Anyways this curry probably isn't as legit as I say (but we are first gen migrants and my mother can cook home food fit for the gods, and this is the recipe that I've learned from her), but its better than packet stuff.\n\nAnyways you need to gather some ingredients which you will probably not find at your supermarket such as Coles or Woolworths (I hear its called Safeway in other states), so head down to your local spice store or asian store and see if they have some of these spices.\n\nThe Ingredients!\n\n* Half a head of garlic (6 cloves, add more if you like)\n* 1 inch of ginger\n* 1/2 T Fennel seeds\n* 2-3 Cloves \n* 2-3 Cardamom\n* Mustard Seeds - enough to kinda loosely cover the bottom of the pan\n* Urud dal - optional, enough to even less loosely cover the bottom of the pan\n* 1 Cinnamon Stick \n* 1 large onion (brown or red doesn't matter, however I hear red onion takes longer to cook)\n* Oil - just a splash of whatever you use (remember Indians don't have olive oil)\n* about 2 cups of milk OR 1/2 can of coconut cream + water (amount depends on how saucy you want it)\n* 2 sticks of curry leaves (that's about 10-15 leaves i think)\n* 500g of MEAT (lamb preferably or goat if you are inclined, stay away from beef as it can be a bit stringy, or try it if you can cook better than me, who struggles to make toast) OR a whole large chicken cut up\n* 1/2 can of peeled diced/whole tomatos OR a whole tomato just dice it\n* 2 - 6 T Curry powder (IMPORTANT: make sure its already roasted, don't buy curry powder that isn't roasted, because to cook the curry powder enough you will burn everything else)\n* Salt to taste\n* Lime juice \n\nThe cooking!\n\n1. Step 1, OK we're starting with the simple stuff, dice the onion (and tomato if your not using canned stuff), garlic and ginger\n2. Mash the garlic and ginger (after peeling them both) together in a mortar and pestle or put in a small blender or that magic bullet they try to sell at 3am in the morning on shopping channels \n3. Heat up a pan on high heat and add some oil\n4. Throw in the diced onion, mustard seeds, fennel seeds, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon stick, urud dal, curry leaves. Cook that until either the urud dal (if you added it) turns brown OR until the onion is browning.\n5. Add the garlic and ginger and cook until it doesn't smell like raw garlic and ginger and keep stirring (its a very powerful smell)\n6. Put the heat on low add 2T of curry powder (no add more you seriously want to) and keep stirring so it doesn't burn. Cook that until the smell of curry powder isn't as strong\n7. Add the canned tomato (or diced tomato with a little water), turn up the heat to medium  and reduce it to a paste so it doesn't have a raw tomato taste (you are ultimately aiming for the oil to separate and the tomato to fry in that oil). \n8. Add the meat on high heat and seal the sides of the meat while mixing it through the tomato spice paste. Add salt to taste\n9. Add the milk/coconut cream to the meat and stir. When the liquids are simmering turn the heat down to low and cover\n10. Cook this on low heat for about 15min and check up on it adding milk/water depending on how saucy you want your curry (if you want more of a dry curry then don't add anything at this stage)\n11. Take the lid off the pan and taste for salt and curry powder you can reduce the curry further by putting it on high heat and leaving the lid off, basic physics really...\n12. If your concoction is a tad salty, add some lime juice towards the end and re-taste  \n13. Nom it over rice\n\nJust a few notes:\n\n* It is imperative that you have the tomato ready to put it when you add the curry powder, the last thing you want is to burn the curry powder. Cooking the already roasted curry powder shouldn't take more than 30 to 40 seconds\n\n* The reason we use roasted curry powder is so the cooking time is lower, my dear old mother complains that in north indian cooking you can taste a raw curry powder flavor and its largely due to the fact they don't cook it long enough (not dissing, but it's how South Indians and Sri Lankans like it). This is why we use roasted curry powder\n\n* Do not fear buying curry powder, it takes the hard work out of dry roasting spices and then grinding them, Props to you if you have to the time to make it yourself for a one off occasion, but having to cook curry every 2 days for dinner it can be a pain in the ass \n\n* Feel free to substitute yogurt (non fat free) for the tomato but reduce the cooking time accordingly. In both cases you are looking for the oil to separate. In the tomato case cook it for awhile to make sure that the tomato flavor isn't overpowering, really cook and burn it down otherwise the whole thing will taste like spicy pasta sauce \n\n* Stick to whole chicken, chicken thighs, chicken legs, goat OR lamb. I find that beef becomes a bit stringy but it could just be due to my inexperience. \n\n* When adding liquids you're either aiming for a thin sauce (best with sting hoppers, use milk and water to thin it out), a thick sauce (best with rice, breads or putu, use milk or coconut cream), or a fry (best with rice, use a little coconut cream and reduce it)\n\n* Make sure you peel the skin off the ginger, my mum said her mum said it was poisonous, my mum gave me a weird look and said it probably just tastes bad and wont kill you XD, but make sure you do it!\n\n* Lastly a quick tip to get the skin off the garlic cloves is make a cut down the fat side, then just take the two halves out as the skin comes right off. You can makes the cuts while the cloves are still part of the whole head of garlic (I thought it was magic when my mum did it so I included it here =P)\n\nOk that's it, I'm just a nublet trying to learn my mothers cooking. She has alot of variations but this is the basic generic eat at home everyday type curry that we cook. When we have a special occasion then we make our own masala and she starts adding lots of other things which I haven't been taught yet XD\n\nCongrats you have made curry, brown person style, its not that hard, stop eating crap-in-a-packet!

Amazing experience, but what I found is that the authenticity is slowly seeping away from my cultural heritage, both in and out of Thailand. \n\nSure, the combination of fresh herbs and spices is going to create something aromatic and yummy, which is great. It doesn't necessarily mean it tastes the way Thai yellow curry should taste. For example, in the recipe you used, it calls for ginger, but actually Galangal is what should be used, also curry power isn't an ingredient we use. Traditionally, root turmeric is the main ingredient by volume, followed by lemongrass, garlic, galangal, red chilli, pepper, shallots and kaffir lime rind.\n\nNonetheless, I am all for experimentation, fusion and personal preference, so it's all good,  but I also believe that there should remain a place for authenticity and tradition, and I hope you will be able to enjoy them both.

This is the first curry I ever made and it's lovely. You can add as much or as little chili as you want. Sorry if the formatting is wro g. I'm posting this from my phone.\n\nRick Stein\u2019s LRamb & Spinach Karahi\n\n\ufffc\nThis recipe is adapted from Rick Stein\u2019s \u201cFood Heroes\u201d book and was given to him by Mumrez Khan when he visited Bradford\u2019s Karachi Restaurant, when filming his TV series of the same name. I love the way the green chillies are added \u2013 they\u2019re blitzed at the end with a little water and added to the curry, giving a delicious, fresh flavour.\nMumrez\u2019s recipe specifies a heart-stopping 250g of ghee (!), which is an Indian clarified butter. I\u2019ve used a more reasonable 150g here, with no resulting loss of flavour. I\u2019ve also modified this recipe to use only 2-3 tbsp oil, which is a lot better for you. Check out my\u00a0Lamb Saag\u00a0recipe for details.\nNote: You do have the option of skimming off some of the ghee at the end of cooking. The best way to achieve this is to leave the pot to stand at a slight angle for 15 minutes. That way, the ghee will collect at one side of the pot where it will be easy to skim off.\nIngredients\n\n150g ghee\n\n550g onions, chopped (about 3 large onions)\n\n65g garlic, peeled (about 1 bulb/12-15 cloves)\n\n50g root ginger, peeled and chopped roughly (about the size of a golf ball)\n\n400g canned tomatoes\n\n200ml water\n\n900g boneless lamb (leg or shoulder), cut into large cubes\n\n1 tbsp sea salt\n\n1 tbsp each of the following: turmeric, red chilli powder, sweet paprika, ground coriander, ground cumin\n\n2 tsp garam masala\n\n200g baby spinach\n\n2-4 medium-sized green chillies, stalks removed\n\n2 handfuls fresh coriander leaves, chopped\n\nAdvertisements\n\nREPORT THIS ADPRIVACY\n\nMethod\n\nHeat the ghee in a large cast-iron casserole. Cook the onions gently for about 20 minutes until soft and light brown in colour. Take the casserole off the heat.\n\nBlitz the garlic, root ginger, tomatoes and water in a blender until smooth. Remove the browned onions using a slotted spoon and add to the blender. Blend again until very smooth.\n\nReturn the mixture to the oil in the casserole and add the lamb and salt. Simmer gently for 30 minutes. The sauce will now be well-reduced.\n\nStir through the ground spices and cook for a further 1\u00bd-2 hours. Add a little water every now and then if the sauce starts to stick.\n\nJust before the lamb is finished cooking, make the spinach puree. Put 150g of the spinach leaves in a large saucepan along with a splash of water. Place a lid on the saucepan and cook for about 2 minutes or until the spinach has wilted down. Transfer the spinach to a liquidizer along with another splash of water and blend until smooth. Set aside.\n\nMake the chilli pure\u00e9. Blend the green chillies with some water until smooth and add to the curry. Set aside.\n\nCheck the lamb is cooked to your satisfaction. At this point, you can spoon off the fat which has risen to the top of the sauce (see below). Stir through the spinach puree and the rest of the spinach leaves. Add the green chilli puree and simmer and heat through for another 10 minutes.\n\nStir through the garam masala and fresh coriander. Taste for seasoning, adding plenty of freshly ground black pepper.

Amazon definitely saves the day for ingredients.\n\nI eat a lot of thai curry so I order things like cans of maesri curry paste, Coconut milk and coconut cream (Coconut milk is really just like 1/3 coconut cream and 2/3 water so if you buy just cream and add water as you want you can get a much creamier curry.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther good things to buy are chili powers, oils, pastes, etc. and dried versions of the eastern ingredients. Sure they aren't quite as good but they do the job.\n\nJapanese curry blocks are great too and most of the ingredients are rather western.\n\nFor Indian curries you can order tomato puree/paste if you can't find it. It's super concentrated and helps thicken your tomato based curries.\n\nYou can also use a bit of cornstarch and if your grocery store doesn't have greek yogurt, plain yogurt also works.

Yoghurt and cream do not like being heated heavily at all as they will split. Coconut milk is okay for this but it\u2019s not necessary to boil it for ages. I think nut based pastes are one of the most effective ways of gaining a silky texture in Indian food and are really underrated.

It's curried lentils, or curried vegetables, or curried meat. It's a style of preparing food, rather than a \"thing\". \n\nSo, like, curried potatoes: dice onions, fry them, add garlic, some ginger (dried red chili pepper if you have it), fry until translucent, add salt, ground turmeric and coriander seed, cumin, fry for 2-3 minutes, add some tomatoes, wait for them to soften, then add boiled potatoes that have been quartered. Add some water so that the flavors absorb and boil for about 5-10 minutes, until most of the water boils off and there's a thick \"sauce\".  Finish with some fresh coriander leaves and maybe some yogurt. Should take 20min.\n\nIt gets way fancier, but that's the basic recipe. You can try it with a combo of hard boiled eggs and potatoes too, if you're feeling fancy. Or chicken too. But it's the method and the spice mixture that people associate with curry.", "That is incredibly helpful. Thank you so much. I have a ton of options it sounds!", "You described a really good base for an Indian curry.\n\nOther options to consider are yogurt, cashew paste, poppyseed paste and of course tomato paste instead of fresh tomatoes. Coconut milk or coconut cream is also used for many Indian curries.", "Indian curry base is usually made of onions and tomatoes. Sometimes yoghurt, cream or cashew paste etc is added to thicken it. The way you cook the onion tomatoes also changes the final taste a lot. Basic curry base is to fry onions till softened and add chopped tomatoes and simmer down till it cooks fully. Add turmeric, ginger, garlic and garam masala (blend of cumin, coriander and some other dry spices) and your base is ready. \nYou can blend this for an even texture. Can add yoghurt, cream or cashew paste (only one) to thicken further. \nAnother way uses onion and tomatoes in paste form. The curry tastes very different if you cook that way as the onions become tangier when blended first then fried. \n\nChicken , paneer, boiled eggs, veggies (egg plants, peas, cauliflower) etc is added later and cooked to complete the curry. \n\nWith some veggies, tomatoes are not needed.

It involves an encounter between ghee (clarified butter) and hot coals in a smoking chamber\u2014most commonly a lidded pot. This interaction produces the smoky, buttery aroma that will perfume any food that you trap inside that pot.\n\nThe goal of the dhungar method is not to hot-smoke food; the heat from that one piece of coal is not enough for any degree of cooking to occur. The main purpose here is to *perfume* food with the specific aroma that\u2019s derived from using heat to alter the molecules of the ghee. The time the food spends in the smoking chamber depends on a few things, including its dimensions and ingredients. But you can follow your own taste and how smoky you like your food to be.

I don't have Cambodian large dried red chiles (which are not very spicy and mainly used for color), so I boiled some chile california for 20 mins and then roughly blended to replicate Cambodian large dried red chile that you see her chopping to a paste in the video. I've done that for other Cambodian recipes and I know a lot of Khmer people in the US use chile california or chile guajillo for that. I used homemade kreung (step 5 in the recipe you linked). I saw and read the recipe you linked and used it for guidance on the whole spices. I didn't roast the shrimp paste like it says in the recipe but fried it like shown in the video. I did not use roasted ground coconut like suggested in your linked recipe, and I did use soft palm sugar like shown in the video.

Thank you for any help that you can give.", "username": "bobthebaco", "upvotes": 14, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Curry/comments/1wpgp8/looking_for_the_stereotypical_indian_curry/", "permalink": "/r/Curry/comments/1wpgp8/looking_for_the_stereotypical_indian_curry/", "comments": ["The westernized curry, fast food style, is often cooked from basic elements prepared in advance. Maybe it's not what you're thinking of, but that's what i know a bit: the thick british/indian curry.\n\nmy curry: http://imgur.com/m5H2N\n\nIt's much easier to make it in rather large quantities since the amount of preparation and time it takes doesn't make sense for only one meal. By that i mean that it takes as much time to make such a curry for 1 person as it takes to make it for 10 servings. So use big pots and make a ton of it! \n\n*when cooking all that you have prepared though, don't make more than 2/3 servings at a time: to get a good result, you need high heat, and only restaurant kitchens can provide enough brutal heat for cooking many portions at a time*\n\n**Preparation** (about 2 hours)\n\nFirst there is the ginger/garlic puree. Put about [250g degermed garlic and 250g ginger root]( http://i.imgur.com/GfptO.jpg) in a blender, with a dash of oil and some water (it will not blend easily without a bit of oil and water.) It keeps at least a week, refrigerated, in a sealed container. The best way to store it though, for home cooking, is to put it in a icetray and store it in the freezer. It will keep for a couple of months and be perfectly portioned for home cooking. \n\nThen there is the tomato sauce, which is 2/3 tomato paste and 1/3 water, often with a pinch of red coloring powder, a dash of citrus juice, and cumin.\n\nLast, the main part of the sauce per volume is a basic onion sauce. Onion are thoroughly cooked in water, [eventually with a carrot, some bell pepper, a bit of white cabbage and some fresh cilantro or parsley...](http://i.imgur.com/gY1Lm.jpg) then mixed with the cooking water in a blender, with some turmeric (a good quantity of it, be reasonable but don't be shy.) The result should be  a thick sauce - so don't overdo it on the amount of water you'll be blending in. By volume, this will be the main element of the finished sauce. The amount of onion sauce you can make in one go in a consumer/normal sized blender should be enough for maybe about 6 servings.\n\n**Cooking** (about 15mn)\n\nThe cooking part consists in toasting some spices (cumin seeds *or* caraway, hand crushed black pepper...) then [frying some garlic ginger puree with some fresh hot pepper if you want](http://imgur.com/mIPId) (two heaping teaspoons of puree per person, cooked on high eat until it will not taste raw) \n\nthen adding a good splash of tomato sauce ([two tablespoons per person, and again cooked on high heat until it won't taste raw](http://imgur.com/P7Fjr)) and methi leaves, parsley or cilantro... \n\nThen is added [the onion sauce](http://imgur.com/lJbeo), 1\u00bd ladle per person. It is generally considered sufficiently cooked when the oil separates (rises on the side of the pan.)\n\nAnd right at the end, a teaspoon of home made spice mix like garam massala. [Here before grinding in a coffee grinder](http://i.imgur.com/7hi4a.jpg) (clockwise from top left: powdered nutmeg, cloves, caraway, coriander, black pepper, green cardamom, true cinnamon)  \n\nI find that fast-cooking meats like chicken can just be put in the completed sauce, and cooked on high heat for about 5/7mn, the less being the better since the chicken will be incredibly tender if cooked just enough to be safe and not a moment more. Meats or vegetables that are longer to cook, just fry them in advance and put them in the finished sauce, and let it cook a moment for the flavors to penetrate the meat and vegetables you just added.", "I [wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/Curry/comments/p0ynt/typical_south_indian_everyday_home_curry/\n) this awhile ago. It's a typical curry that we eat at home everyday", "From my experience, SORTED Food's Chicken Korma is pretty easy to make and quite \"stereotypical curry tasting\" IMO. Modified it a bit actually, but I think it's a very nice easy to make curry.\n\n\nAll you need to do is blend up an onion, 2 cloves of garlic, a thumbsized piece of ginger, optionally some chilli if you like it spicy, 2 tsp of both garam masala and curry powder, 1/2-1 tsp of salt and pepper, a couple of almonds and 1-2 tbsp of dessicated coconut. That amount of paste is about right for 500g of meat.\n\nYou put some oil in a deep pan and add your paste, cook it for about 3-5 minutes. In the original recipe it says you should add 3 cardamom pods and a stick of cinnamon in the pan too, but if you don't have these at home I don't think it makes such a huge difference.\n\nAt this point I usually add the meat, fry it off a little, then add enough water to not quite cover the meat (also you'll add some more liquid to it later). In the original recipe it's milk, but I don't like it that bright personally.\n\nNow just cook until your meat is cooked through and the sauce has thickened. At this point you can add your cream or yogurt, I personally add Greek yogurt as it's a good compromise of the 2, but if you add yogurt be sure you turn the heat off first and take it off the heat immediately.\n\n\nIt's as easy as it goes without too many ingredients.\nIf you want it even easier just buy a jar of curry paste and cook the curry as the instructions say.", "There is no such thing.", "This recipe is legit!

Rules such as 50/50 garlic ginger, more coriander than everything else, spice wise. Not too much turmeric...\n\nAnyway, my latest one that's gotten the most praise is -\n\n4 Tbsp oil. I use rape seed.\n\nHeat it, add 1 tsp of cumin seeds. Add a blob of butter for good measure. Cook it fairly high until the aromas are released, but be careful not to burn. Then add 3 or 4 chopped onions, fry until softened. Then add 50/50 garlic and ginger. In my experience, you can't add too much. Seriously, even what seems ridiculous amounts doesn't appear to overwhelm the dish. Maybe 8 cloves and equal weight ginger. Chuck it in, cook the rawness out. Then add 4 or 5 sliced tomatoes (or a 400g tin of chopped tomatoes). Lid on ideally, cook this down until it all breaks up. Now it's time for the spices.\n\n1tsp cumin powder\n\n1 tsp turmeric powder\n\n1 Tbsp coriander powder (tablespoon!)\n\n1 1/2 tsp hot chilli powder (obviously depends on you. This'll make your nose run but is easily edible for anyone that's used to spice, so edit accordingly) \n\n1 tsp garam masala\n\n1 tbsp curry powder\n\nBig pinch of dried fenugreek leaves \n\n1/2 tsp salt (don't oversalt at this stage, the easiest way to ruin a curry, plus we're adding stock later) \n\nStir this in and cook the rawness out. \n\nAdd (if possible) 2 tbsp of mango chutney, 2 tbsp mint sauce, 2 tbsp tomato puree. Optional squeeze of lemon. \n\nNow add diced raw chicken (around 600-800g,but doesn't really matter) Stir it in, the \"sauce\" will be very pasty at the minute. Coat the chicken in the paste and cook it just enough until it starts changing colour. \n\nThen add just enough chicken stock (made as per the instructions on the stock) to cover all the meat. Now is also a good time to add in any vegetables you like really. A sliced pepper (Bell pepper if you're American). In fact if you're American, replace the word coriander with cilantro, we say coriander in the UK. Anyway, just add whatever freshly chopped veg. Half a sliced onion, sliced tomatoes, even par boiled potatoes if you like. Or a few whole chillies, or finely chopped. \n\nGently simmer this for at least half an hour, more likely 45 minutes, ensure that the chicken is cooked. Make sure to stir it frequently and to scoop the dried bits off the sides and get it back in to the dish. This is extra flavour. Once the chicken is cooked, add in a big handful of roughly chopped coriander taste and check if it's seasoned to your taste. Dish up, sprinkle on a touch more freshly chopped coriander and enjoy! Serve with naan, poppadoms and rice. If any of the ingredients are difficult to get where you are, amazon will probably offer it. \n\nThat was a lot of effort to type on my phone lol.

The only thing that is missing is the subtle smoky flavour to the chicken, but out of all the restaurants I've tried, only one has had that so criticisms and improvement ideas are welcome because right now I'm living in an suburb that doesn't have a good Indian restaurant and I like to cook, so here's the recipe:\n\n**For the chicken marinade:**\n\n* 1kg chicken thighs, boneless and skinless, cut into 3-4cm pieces (or chicken breast if you prefer)\n\n* 2-3 garlic cloves, finely crushed (or 2 or 3 teaspoons of garlic paste)\n\n* 2.5cm ginger, finely grated ( or 2.5 teaspoons of ginger paste)\n\n* \u00be tsp fine sea salt\n\n* \u00be tsp hot chilli powder\n\n* 40mls lemon juice\n\n* 100mls (175g) natural yoghurt\n\n* \u00be tsp garam masala\n\n* \u00be tsp ground turmeric\n\n* 1\u00bc tsp ground cumin\n\n* 2-3 tbsp vegetable oil for brushing\n\n**For the sauce:**\n\n* 4 tbsp ghee\n\n* 5 garlic cloves, crushed\n\n* 5cm ginger, finely chopped\n\n* 3 cardamom pods, seeds crushed\n\n* 5 cloves, crushed\n\n* 2\u00bd tsp ground coriander\n\n* 2\u00bd tsp garam masala\n\n* 2\u00bd tsp ground turmeric\n\n* 700ml tomato puree (passata)\n\n* 2 tsp lemon juice\n\n* 100g of finely blended almonds (or almond meal)\n\n* 100g butter\n\n* 300ml double cream\n\n* coriander, chopped to garnish\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Place the chicken in a bowl with the garlic, ginger, salt, chilli powder and lemon juice. Mix, cover with plastic wrap and chill for 30 mins (the chicken too, not just you).\n\n2. Mix together the yogurt, garam masala, turmeric and cumin and add to the chicken, making sure that each piece is well coated with the mixture. Cover again and chill for 3-4 hours.\n\n3. Preheat the oven to 180\u00baC/Fan 160\u00baC/gas mark 4. Put the marinated chicken pieces on a grill rack, brush with a little oil and set on a baking tray and bake for 8-10 mins. Brush the chicken pieces with a little oil and turn them over. Bake for another 10-12 mins until just cooked through.\n\n4. For the sauce: Heat the ghee in a pan and add the garlic and ginger. Fry for a minute or so then add the cardamom, cloves, coriander, garam masala and turmeric.\n\n5. Stir well and fry for 1-2 mins until they give off a lovely aroma. Stir in the tomato puree (passata) and lemon juice and cook for another couple of mins.\n\n6. Add the finely blended almonds (or almond meal) and stir to combine.\n\n7. If you are going to blend for a smoother sauce with a hand mixer or traditional blender then this would be the time to do it, otherwise carry on.\n\n8. Add the chicken pieces to the sauce and stir well to coat.\n\n9. Finally, add the butter and cream and stir continuously until the butter has melted and the sauce is smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning.\n\n10. Transfer to a warm bowl and serve hot with rice or naan, garnished with chopped coriander.\n\nHere's the full album of the procedure: https://imgur.com/a/dGO8MnC", "Thanks for this.

Check out Al's Kitchen on YouTube. He focuses on British Indian Restaurant (BIR) style curries and I must say it's been a game changer for me as I live in France (but from the U.K). I'd suggest looking at his base gravy receipe to begin as it is used as a base for many different styles of curries/dishes he makes on the channel. It's a lot of preparation but once you've got your base gravy, you can freeze it and store it to make about 6-7 dishes depending on the receipe.\n\n[Al's Kitchen base gravy receipe V.1](https://youtu.be/xbW2NyoXVts)", "When I've made bland curries, it's usually because I was too conservative with the spices.", "What style of curry are you trying to recreate?", "It depends on the style of curry but if you cook indian curries I'd suggest using a lot of ghee or oil for cooking the spices and make a good massala/chaunk (maybe follow a recipe the first times to know which spices to fry) by checking that oil temperature is hot enough for the spices to fry and if you are using tomatoes afterwards just make sure they are well cooked with the spices", "Watch videos made by people of the culture your curry is from.", "I make a ton of curries and I\u2019m currently doin pop ups for them and it all came from not knowing what I was doing.  These are the tips I\u2019ve used to better my curries:\n\n1.  Coconut milk base-I will never use anything else.  It\u2019s thick.  Sweet.  Flavorful.  Not over powering.  \n\n2.  Carrots, onions, peas/peppers.  Like a mire poix, these vase vegetables add a nice bit of flavor.  Saut\u00e9 them Al center with salt and pepper before adding them to the coconut milk.\n\n3.  Pick UP TO 5 spices and learn to balance (this includes pepper). I generally use Tumeric and fenugreek as my base flavor spices (you can sub fenugreek for maybe cardamom, garlic, or get crazy and use dried cilantro) along with ginger, pepper, and mustard or cumin.  It sounds complex but once u get balancing down u can begin adding even more spices.  It\u2019s all a dance really and the more players the more potential problems.  Balance is key\n\n4.  Toast spices before grinding them if u can.  Mellows out the flavor but makes it more robust.  Untoasted spices are fresh and forward.\n\n5.  Make sure to use salt AND an acid like lime\u2026just use lime.  Salt keeps stuff from tasting bland and acids like lime just does the thing.  It harmonizes with all the flavors and balances stuff out.\n\nThere is more but this is enough for a beginner to chew on.  \n\nTake away is to not be stingy with the spices, salt your food, use lime juice, and taste your food every chance u can.

I\u2019m a vegetarian and I\u2019m going to a nice Indian restaurant for a work event in a couple of days. I would usually have vegetable korma with onion fried rice. Going to the Indian was always a once in a blue moon treat as a child and we hardly had any money so as a vegetarian child I always went for korma as it was the cheapest. It\u2019s become a comfort food since then and one of my favourite foods. \n\nOnce I mentioned this to my coworker she got a bit upset. She said korma was the most boring and childish option and whenever she sees someone order it she\u2019s so embarrassed. She said if I order it she will have to apologise to the staff for me which I really don\u2019t want. So I\u2019ve got to find a new favourite curry from now on, which is sad but I don\u2019t want to be seen as boring or childish to anyone. \n\nI like spice and can eat most things vegetarian accept mushrooms. So a spicy curry would be fine for me to eat.

Baingan bharta if you like eggplants, or even a mushroom masala if they have it. \n\nBut I\u2019m not sure what part of the world you are in and there is a huge regional variation in what Indian restaurant cuisine is. Best thing to do imo is look up a menu or reviews for the place before you go and see what is recommended, by the restaurant and patrons.

[But you don't want to put them right at the beginning; they will break down in the cooking process. 2/3 hours before you want to serve your meal.] You can also add in some carrots, if you like. I also add in some fresh garlic too. Up to you. 1 - 2 chopped large onions - medium will do. And you can use a small tin of tomato paste. \n\nYour choice of meat is going to influence cooking time; the tougher the meat [like mutton, the longer the cooking time] - low and slow will work for all meat, but just take note of mutton. \n\nHow you'd cook this all, the easy way.\n\n* Medium heat warm a frying pan\n* Add in butter; reduce heat if it dissolves too quickly and starts to smoke\n* Put in spice mix and stir for 2/3 minutes to release the fragrances [except bay leaves and cinnamon stick/s]\n* Add in your meat to brown with the spices\n* Put in your onions / fresh garlic [2/3 cloves]\n* Add in other vegetables [remember that potatoes break down, so depending on cooking heat ... not too soon, and not too late.]\n* Stir on medium for 3-5 minutes\n* Transfer to a pot\n* Add in 2-3 [or so] cups of water [add in cinnamon and bay leaves]\n* Reduce to simmer [so you barely see movement on the top of the water]\n* In 4-6 hours it should have all be ready [potatoes can go in 2-3 hours before serving time.]\n\nThat's a very long way of doing it. You can do it faster, by increasing the heat after you have added in the water, to a medium heat and then reducing. That would take [excluding mutton] to get a very tender curry.\n\nIf you can tell me more about what you're cooking with, and how long you can / want to cook for, we can adjust this recipe to your needs.\n\nYou can vary most of these ingredients to your taste. Tamarind adds a lovely flavour profile too, however it might not be to everyone's tastes. You can add in chillies [birds eye] for more heat. It depends on what you're looking for. If you need to thicken the curry, so it's not watery, then you can increase the heat and let some water boil off. Personally, I don't like watery curry. I like a thick gravy type. \n\nHope this helps!", "Thank you so much for this wonderful response! Honestly, this is much more than I expected.\nWe will probably be using chicken as the meat since it's cheap and easy to get, though I'm not certain of how much to use. Regarding spices, I absolutely love a fragrant, spicy curry (just not so much that it covers up the flavor.)\nI also agree with you on preferring thick curries. The thicker it is, the better it is for being soaked up by naan, rice, or whatever I'm eating it with!", "You're very welcome :-)\n\nHere's a little tip for you; add all the spices together [you can double the amounts, or triple them] ... and put them in a jar. So, you're always good to go and don't have to fuss with taking things out and then putting them away. I personally make enough \"spice mix\" for about 4-5 curries at a time. \n\nIf I want to adjust something, then I can add in extra ginger or maybe some lemon grass, or whatever else I feel like. \n\nA really great vegetable to put in to a curry [it will take probably on a slow cook, about 1/1.5 hours to cook nicely through] - is aubergine. You can also fry it beforehand and add it in. It works very nicely. :-)\n\nSo, for chicken quantities, we assume the following. I would get 1/1.5 chicken breasts per person. If kids are involved [you may want to make a separate mix, leaving out the Kashmiri Mirch ... and other hotness] - they will probably be coming in at 1/2 to 3/4 of a piece of chicken. Just make sure that you don't add any water to your chicken and spice mix, or else the cooking will be a bit weird.\n\nYou can also take your mix, and then grab some pre-made Tandoori paste mix or Kashmiri paste mix; two tablespoons of either paste, or one of each ... and half a lemon ... two tablespoons [or three] of Greek yoghurt, and mix them all together for a marinade. Put your chicken in to that overnight or at most, 24 hours before you cook it. And then either bake or broil the marinated chicken. It will also be quite delicious.\n\nAnd talking of lemon; you can also add half a lemon or some lime juice to your curry. [Additionally, you can marinate your chicken in 1-2 lemons worth of juice, overnight, before you cook it. It will tenderise and flavour your chicken even more. This would apply for general cooking too; lemon, salt and pepper ... and maybe some thyme ... baked or broiled / grilled ... it's great!]\n\nA nice way to thicken up your curry, would be to use some extra potatoes, cut in to smaller pieces, as they will disintegrate during cooking. \n\nOne more little tip :-)\n\nIf you have left over gravy, then you can pop some boiled eggs in there and let them jam with the juices, and you'll have some curried eggs. Getting your mileage out of this meal.\n\nYou can also add your spice mix to minced meat / ground beef [maybe leave out the coriander seeds and cumin seeds] ... and add in a handful of raisins ... yes, raisins and you will have a very savoury dish. \n\n:-)", "You are an absolute blessing, thank you!  I've wanted to get into cooking curry more regularly with a steady recipe for a while, and this one seems so fun and easy to follow, with plenty of room for customization! I'll be trying it out in the next couple weeks, so I'll try to remember to post the result in the subreddit.\n\nAgain, I can't thank you enough for your help here!", "Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share with you. And thank you so much for your kindness. \n\nThere is plenty of room for customization; you got my point! Hahaha.\n\nA few other great time savers; if you can ginger and garlic paste - go for it! I make my own, but I also buy it. Lasts a while, and it's good for all sorts of other cooking. :-)\n\nFurther to this; you can also add in ... wait for it ... some mint or mint sauce, if you can get it ... it also brings out some additional flavours. Particularly in marinades. It works really well. And if you have to get cheaper cuts of beef to cook with, you can also use the lemon juice to tenderise the beef. It breaks down the protein bonds, and makes it easier to cook with.\n\nIf you have any other questions, or need any other help, then please let me know. I am excited for you and your adventures! :-)"], "urlNames": [], "urlLink": [[], [], [], [], []]}

", "Kotaku is basically a bunch of freelance writers with little to no life experience that try to cobble together a website. \n\nTrusting Kotaku as a source for anything is like trusting a starving rabid raccoon with your groceries, or trusting a Republican with your civil liberties and healthcare. \n\nEdit: Also, proving a negative is not easy. Why would anyone list a series of ingredients that they DON'T use? Try listing me your multiple sources first. I've never seen anything about Japanese usin cheese or chocolate in curry, so show me.", "[deleted]", "Did you read your sources?\n\nThe first one only off-handedly remarks that \"some people\" might put chocolate or cheese in their curry, among a list of other purported ingredients that are also said to be people's personal \"secret ingredient.\" It isn't evencreally specifying Japanese people, either.\n\nThe second link mentions that there *MIGHT* be cheese or *cocoa powder* in he roux bricks, but says nothing about anyone adding any cheese or chocolate to curry. \n\nThe third link finally has an example of at least a person of Japanese decent using chocolate in curry, yet even he admits, \"Some may see my philandering as infidelity towards my original Japanese Curry Rice...\" It seems he recognizes his ingredient additions as a deviation from the norm, and more of a specific subset of curry known as Kuro Curry. It doesn't mention cheese anywhere though. \n\nAnother Japanese person but still seemingly not a native Japanese person, since she buys her cheese at Costcoz She uses cheese, but has never tried chocolate. It seems like, instead of these being truly Japanese additions or well known \"secret ingredients,\" it's more of a person mix based off of experimentation and personal preference, as well as specific to a flavor profile you want to build. \n\nThe last one is just a random user submitted recipe. It really doesn't offer proof of anything.\n\nSo it seems to me, all you have really shown is that some people, particularly, some Western Japanese people use chocolate or chews, but I never saw a reference for both.\n\nI still think the Kotaku writer just heard this shit somewhere and thought it was truly authentic, and then latched onto it thinking it was truly a Japanese secret, when it is nothing more than part of a personal preference. Kotaku writers are almost always idiots like that. \n\nIt sounds to me, the most truly Japanese thing is to experiment, build and test different flavor profiles, and try your own personal additions to your curry, rather than ever settling down to one single combination. ", "I found the same sources, and since I'm not Japanese and have no intention to learn Japanese simply to discover whether or not they use Chocolate or Cheese in the recipe, it doesn't mean that Japanese people don't.\n\nTo your points, sure, the second link doesn't necessarily encourage including cheese or chocolate, but there's not MIGHT about it. It's IN the roux, depending on the brand or type.\n\nThe third link mentioning that it's an \"infidelity\" is in reference against his own original recipe, not Japanese Curry as a whole. And what does it matter if his use of chocolate is more in line with a Kuro Curry or not, that's still a Japanese Curry. It would fall under the same logic as a place that makes sweet curry with honey and apples versus a spicy and savory variant that I have used and had experienced at multiple curry spots (although, perhaps to your point, these were in the States or in Korea). \n\nAnd as for the rest, you're right, it's a matter of personal preference to what can boost the flavor or offer a refreshing new take on Japanese Curry, which is what I took from this Kotaku article, and many others. \n\nHaving the article made on Kotaku as opposed to his own personal blog elsewhere does not weaken his suggestions, especially when it gets echoed elsewhere. This is a subreddit about curry and ALL the various versions of it, NOT your personal soapbox for why Kotaku is shit and should be boycotted.\n\nThat being said, I will say that I still don't necessarily disagree with your take on Kotaku itself. I've got no problems with half the articles that come through, but I also prefer Polygon and various other sources. So in that regard, sure, let's discredit this guy's personal experience because he's a Kotaku-published writer, assume that his own curry cooking expertise is tarnished even though he clearly seems as passionate about Japanese curry as anyone else here is about curry in general. That's perfectly fine as an opinion of yours. I won't knock you on that.\n\nAnd the last thing you wrote is probably the most agreeable thing I've read in a long time. Japanese food has always been about two things, tradition and adaptation. (three things if you include aesthetics). I don't think Japanese food, or culture, ever feels any sense of 'cultural appropriation' when non Japanese people adapt it to their own tastes (Ramen, anyone?).\n\nSo with that in mind, maybe don't be such a militant anti-Kotaku poster telling people to NOT put cheese or chocolate into their curry since you admit that the most truly Japanese thing to is go ahead and experiment."], "urlNames": [{"error": "HTTP Error 403: Forbidden"}], "urlLink": [[], [], [], [], ["http://japanese-kitchen.net/popular-secret-ingredients-to-make-curry-rice-even-better/"], [], [], [], [], []]}

Not an expert by any means but I like making indian curry so maybe this is useful. This is definitely an Americanized answer but it should get you on your way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst off you've got a spicy indian curry powder. It's main ingredients are Turmeric, Cumin, and Ginger. So any curry recipe with those three would be a good start.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMilk isn't used often as far as I know. Most recipes I've seen call for butter, ghee, greek yogurt, coconut milk, cream, or heavy cream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome common Indian curries include: Korma, Jalfrezi, Dhansak, Madras, and Vindaloo. Look them up, (A google image search helps if you are trying to remember a dish.) Avoid anything with Masala in the name, as garam masala is different from curry powder (no tumeric) although don't actually avoid those dishes because they are also delicious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost recipes are pretty easy to follow for curry. A lot of them tend to follow the same pattern:\n\n1. Cook your onions in butter or ghee until soft (longer than usual for most.)\n2. Add your spices and cook til fragrant (like 30 seconds.)\n3. Add your vegetables and the rest of your sauce ingredients and let simmer (sometimes dairy is added towards end.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4-ish) Your protein can be cooked separate (broil, grill, etc.) or you can let it simmer with everything else. It's often marinated first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously follow an actual recipe but hopefully this gives you enough keywords to get started.

You can just cut them back hard if they get too big and they'll spring right back.  I have had problems with them getting scale insects in the winter.  It's almost impossible to grow them from cuttings but they grow easily from seed.  The only problem with that is the seed won't store...you have to plant them immediately before they dry out.  I used to let my plant go dormant...dropping all the leaves in winter but now I keep them watered enough to keep them green...though I'm not diligent enough to keep them pampered enough to bloom.    Brushing the flowers seems to help pollination.  I've done it in years past and it's not difficult...you just have to keep them watered consistently.

Anyway, I watched a couple videos and it all looked good and he was making the curry in an actual restaurant. I tried making the same thing today thinking that I had found the secret. When it was done it tasted sour and had an overpowering taste of onion, it was bad. Can anyone tell me what I did wrong? My suspiciouns are that I either have too much onion, too little oil, too much yogurt, or I didn't cook it long enough. If you're are curious this is exactly what I did:\n-Filled a pan with oil (about 5-6 tbsp olive oil)\n-Put a whole grated onion in along with bay leaves, cardamom pods and a star anise\n-Added 1 tbsp of ginger and one of garlic\n-Waited until onion browned, then added some water\n-Put in tumeric, cumin, coriander, chili powder, garham masala (1 tbsp of each) \n-Poured in a whole can of tomato puree\n-Put in 5 tbsp of Straus European yogurt.\n-Added vegetables/meat", "username": "bib_1", "upvotes": 8, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Curry/comments/fx2i55/whats_wrong_with_my_curry/", "permalink": "/r/Curry/comments/fx2i55/whats_wrong_with_my_curry/", "comments": ["Use ghee or a higher smoke point oil, avoid olive oil...add dried spices and tomatoes before water stirring vigorously to form a paste before adding liquid.

Also if you have access to an Indian or Asian grocery shop there, find curry leaves and also methi(fenugreek leaves) add deep layers of flavor...I can\u2019t think of anything else at the moment but I know I\u2019m missing something. Curry to non SE Asian and Indian subcontinental folks I feel is both an adventure and a risk/reward process...I am Latino and grew up cooking vegetarian Mexican food, got a job in a few modern American kitchens and also worked in an Indonesian kitchen, my adventure has been long and good but I am just a home cook now. Hope you find the flavor you are seeking.", "I am Indian and a chef. If you put in 1 tbsp of turmeric, you have put in about 8 times more than you should have. It is an incredibly strong flavour that will ruin a dish in excess. Garam masala too is way too much. Indians don't use olive oil in cooking (though that's probably not the culprit here.)\n\nChicken Tikka Masala was invented in the UK, not India. If you want the Indian version, look up Butter Chicken.\n\nThis is a decent recipe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a03U45jFxOI", "Did you cook your onions enough? I normally go sliced, but there's a few of my mums recipes that want them blended and it takes so long to cook them through. If they're not cooked through properly (and all the onion water evaporated off), she warns the whole dish can taste like raw onion.\n\nAlso, how big is a can of tomato puree? I'd say you'd want a can of tomatoes, and a maybe few tbsp of puree (but I'm imagining a 400g of puree which would be really sour - unless you mean just blended tomatoes like passata). Did the tomato caramelise or cook through properly?", "The secret to restaurant curries is salt and oil. You have waaay too little oil, might have burnt the onions and a restaurant would use a master stock instead of water. You can do a quick curry stock yourself (root veg, coriander stalks, onions, meat bones and chicken wings if you aren't vegetarian, curry spices particularly star anise, simmer on low). I find this adds layers of flavour. Finally, frying off the spices in oil first to toast and brown them is an important step, edit, all these: \"turmeric (v short time as easy to burn), cumin, coriander, chili powder, garham masala (1 tbsp of each)\". You can do this in a corner if the pan by moving the onions to one side. \n\nHope some of that helps!", "Did you use extra virgin olive oil? You aren't suppose to cook with that. It has a low smoking point.", "If your curry tasted of boiled onion, the pan wasn\u2019t hot enough. You need to fry the sauce rather than boil it. The onions in the gravy caramelise", "Other than what others have said, I can only add that I frequently find it necessary to add a teaspoon of sugar to the gravy; which takes away the sourness of the tomatoes.", "You need to saut\u00e9 the onion until they are slightly brown, this process can be made slightly quicker by sprinkling some salt while the onions are frying, salt help onion loose moisture quicker so it browns quicker. Now add some Turmeric powder this will do the final job of removing any remaining raw onion smell. Hope this helps.", "Your problem is the onions need to be caramelised, this can take 15-40 minutes.", "too much tumeric and garham masala and you must cook out the spices in the water", "I probably use too much turmeric and garlic masala based on your response hahaha, good to know.", "As an amateur/home curry cook i'm really happy you said tumeric / garam masala as the issue because that's exactly what i thought when reading \" (1 tbsp of each)\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni'm getting there!", "Yeah, I think that the problem was with the onions not cooking long enough. I am surprised no one thinks the yogurt is the problem because that's what I thought at first.", "Thank you, how much more oil do you think.", "5-6 tablespoons is way too little oil? I don\u2019t agree with that at all. That\u2019s a fuckton of oil for how op describes his dish, restaurant style or not.", "When I'm making chicken tikka masala, I use yogurt in my marinade (you should be marinating your chicken too, by the way), and then after cooking the chicken, I use only cream or half and half for dairy in my sauce. I like to add most of the cream towards the start of making my sauce, and then I reserve a little as a final touch at the end of cooking.\n\nWithout knowing how much chicken you were using, it's hard to say if your onion or tomato amounts were too high, but they seem like they might be on the high end. Otherwise, there is some good advice in this thread, try cooking your onions longer, use ghee or butter, too much turmeric, etc.\n\nOne final tip for cutting down acid from tomatoes, try adding just a little bit of white sugar, maybe 1/2 tsp or less at a time before doing a taste test. If you add just the right amount, it'll reduce the acid without any noticeable sweetness.", "Ghee is usually used over oil, as it adds that buttery taste. If you don't gave access to Ghee, add the oil plus a few tablespoons of butter. That will up the oil content plus add some buttery goodness.", "The OP didn't mention weights or measures, but at the English take away curry places I know well, that's far less ghee then is used for a dish, particularly one with lean/dry meat and less dairy/cream/yog, like chicken tikka massala. It sounds a lot, I am always surprised when I see it in the making. \n\nEvery place different though, we can both be right here I think."], "urlNames": [{"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}], "urlLink": [[], ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a03U45jFxOI"], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]}

Use chicken thigh cut into large chunks. Way juicier, fattier, better flavor. This is a rich dish. The only time I would recommend using chicken breast is if you have some way of actually preparing tandoori chicken(as they do in the restaurants for this dish). If you can achieve juicy, grill-like, chicken breast cubes, go for it. If you're just using a pan, I strongly recommend skipping the breast and going with thigh.\n\n* Fry a small amount of tomato paste in the oil before you add tomatoes. Get it fragrant in the oil, flipping it and frying it gently and patiently to develop intense flavor. Butter chicken has to be intensely tomato-y, because the cream and butter tend to mask the umami amino acids in the tomato, it helps to go all-in with a tomato concentrate of some kind if you don't have amazing tomatoes available.\n\n* As per one of Vahchef's recipes, who imo has the best butter chicken on youtube(The old recipe), a tablespoon of ketchup and sugar really rounds out the gravy. Again, pretty common restaurant procedure. You want that tart and sweet, lip-smacking effect. The sauce **has** to make your lips smack, or it just won't have the wow-factor as you put it. Ketchup and sugar achieves this. Not too much.\n\n* Kasoori Methi is not optional. You need this crucial herb, or it just won't have that magical buttery herby flavor.\n\nBest of luck. \n", "What's the recipe?", "Fenugreek leaves gives it that real curry taste could need that? Depends what your normal taste curry is. Or maybe coriander seeds?\n\n&#x200B;", "Hmm I\u2019m not sure. Maybe the quality of the tomatoes. Used raw Roma tomatoes. ", "This is very good input.

After experimenting a ton with different spices, I now use a big spoonful of patak's on top of my dry spices because it's just great.  I want to try making a curry paste similarly and see how it turns out after some time in the fridge.  The really important spices are coriander, cumin, fenugreek, red pepper, whole green cardamom, whole cinnamon, and whole cloves.  Some black mustard seed is also good to have.\n\nThere was a [good thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/try4p/what_is_the_best_indian_cookbook_you_have_come/) in /r/indianfood for cookbook recommendations the other day.\n\nBe sure to post pics of your attempts for purposes of curry porn, good luck!\n", "This is probably going to offend anyone that is serious about curry's but I like to make what I call \"ghetto curry\".  I sautee up whatever veggies that I have around that are popular for indian dishes (cauliflower, mushrooms, peas, onion, spinach, etc..).  Then I put some pasta sauce over it but not too much, you just want a light coat.  Then add some curry powder to taste.  Let it simmer for a bit so the powder infuses into the sauce.\n\nThis works great when I need a meal but I don't want to spend a lot of time on it.", "[Chicken Tika Masala](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/chicken-tikka-masala/) is a delicious, creamy, \"entry-level\" Indian-style dish that actually originated in the UK.  You can adjust the amount of spiciness to your personal taste.  It's so popular in the UK that it's been named the national dish, along with fish & chips.  \n\nMy personal favourites are Madras and Vindaloo curries, but they're much spicier and not quite as simple to make.  \n\nThai curries are great too, but usually have fish sauce in them, which some people aren't so crazy about.", "Internet is the way to go if you want authentic Indian recipes (and probably other regional cuisine). For Indian, look in particular for aunties or housewives/mommies that have blogs. I'm not joking! Manjula is good for Jain pure vegetarian N Indian cuisine. Kanchana also makes vegetarian South Indian and other food at Married to a Desi, though it appears she may have merged with her sister's site. \n\n\nYoutube is also a great resource. I've never tried anything from Show Me the Curry, but the two cooks that host the show are entertaining and the food is approachable. One girl is originally from the N and one is originally from the S, so they try a variety of regional food, including street food like Frankies. There's also SuperVeggieDelight (Bhavna), who I think is Gujarati. She has a few good videos on \"stocking the Indian pantry\". I think what she has should basically cover what's needed in other regional cuisines. As you make more and more Indian food, you'll probably get a feel for what you use on a regular basis and buy supplies accordingly. \n\nI also advocate for YT and blogs because the people who run them tend to update fairly regularly, and especially if they are not living in India, they may have had to be creative in the past if they did not have access to Indian stores. They will be able to answer questions promptly and tell you what substitutions/omissions you can make if you don't have some ingredients. And if you do have access to Indian stores, they can tell you what brands or items that they prefer. \n\n\nZeetv's YT channel hosts Khana Khazana, which is famous chef's Sanjeev Kapoor's show. He sells a line of mixes and such which I have seen at the store. Be wary - the show is not in English though the video titles are. You can probably follow along, particularly when you've gotten used to ingredients and cooking methods. If you can find clips of cooking shows from Indian channels, like Aaha Enna Rusi/Jacob's Kitchen, these will be most authentic! Jacob (my dad is obsessed with him and has tried some of his recipes) cooks S Indian, including lots of nonveg stuff. The show is not in English though. \n\n\nThere's another chef - vahchef Sanjay Thamma who hosts on YT as well. He makes veg and nonveg food and he categorizes all his food by playlist. He makes N and S cuisine. He uses channa dal in his dosai, which I don't think is normal, but whatever. His show is in English. \n\n", "I like to do this as well but i use a can of diced tomatoes instead of sauce to make it a little more chunky", "You really can't taste the fish sauce in Thai curry.

{"id": "daxvhk", "title": "Cheap Curry that tastes good?", "body": "Hello! Always been a fan of curry, my grandmothers doctor is a life long family friend, and being from India he was the one who introduced me and the rest of my family to the delicious dish. Every Thanksgiving and Christmas he and his family would always stop by, with a delicious dish of Indian Lamb Curry. Always a favorite. \n\nNow that I've got the backstory out of the way, on to the point of this post. For the past four years I've found a good cheap curry that I can make at home with little effort. I use those wonderful curry roux blocks either from Golden Curry or Vermont. Below is my current recipe. It's cheap, so don't be expecting anything special.\n\n\\-Get a pan or pot on medium heat with vegetable or peanut oil.(I haven't noticed that much of a difference, but I do usually prefer peanut oil)\n\n\\-Get a tablespoon of chopped garlic(I use canned) and dump that into the pan/pot\n\n\\-Add onion powder generously, and some more powdered garlic if you feel like you didn't get enough later on.\n\n\\-Cook till they're just getting golden, then add crush canned tomatoes. You can use diced or even sauce, I just prefer the texture that crushed gives.\n\n\\-Add in your curry roux block, it's important to do it here because it's going to mix together with all those previous flavors and give you a very thick result. \n\n\\-Add in your vegetables if you have any. I prefer to add canned peas and carrots(you can get a can that has both), and some canned whole potatoes that I cut into 8's.\n\n\\-Cook until the potatoes are soft enough you can stick a fork in and pull it out with no issue\n\n\\-Now me personally, I can't justify buying lamb all the time, so I prefer to use chicken tenderloins. Before all of this it's important to have cut the chicken into bite sized bits(freeze the chicken for a bit to make it firmer and easier to cut), and I also let it soak in Pineapple juice for an hour to REALLY tenderize it. Season with your choice, then cook for a bit however you like(JUST MAKE SURE YOU DON'T ADD RAW CHICKEN TO THE POT)\n\n\\-After chicken is cooked, add to pot with the rest, let it soak in all that goodness.\n\n\\-Now right now this could be fine, if it's a little strong for you I reccomend adding some ketchup. It's sweet, and it gives a tomato flavor. \n\n\\-Personaly I like to add a cup and a half of milk to it, to give the curry a nice and creamy texture.\n\n\\-Cook, till it gets that creamy texture you want.\n\n\\-Serve on jasmine rice(uncle Ben's of course :D) and enjoy.\n\nJust felt like sharing this recipe with you all, hope you enjoyed.", "username": "A_Lighthouse", "upvotes": 8, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Curry/comments/daxvhk/cheap_curry_that_tastes_good/", "permalink": "/r/Curry/comments/daxvhk/cheap_curry_that_tastes_good/", "comments": ["I\u2019d recommend cooking the chicken first and removing so the crispy cooked bits and flavor remains in the on when you move to aromatics."], "urlNames": [], "urlLink": [[]]}

I've found a few things have helped:\n\n- Not searing the chicken/meat before hand, let it cook in the sauces.\n\n- Using a slow cooker or crockpot has shown to make the meat much more tender and absorb the flavors of the curry more.\n\nThese things have helped the meat, but the sauces still lack something.

I own a shaker of curry powder, but I use it exclusively to add a bit of curry flavor to random concoctions that I'm trying. If I'm making a true curry, the curry powder stays in the cabinet.\n\nBuy your spices whole and fresh from an Indian or Asian grocery store. Buy new spices every year or two, even if you haven't run out of what you have. Experiment with Garam Masala recipes and find something that works for your tastes. You should be toasting the whole spices yourself in a pan, and grinding them yourself. I recommend a coffee grinder. \n\nI've also had problems with curry flavors not popping, and every time, the answer has been to do better with my spices. While the handling of the meat matters, it's comparatively unimportant. If all of your spices are fresh and mixed by you, you're set up for success.

I'll apologize in advance for the wall of text as I'm on mobile. It takes some work and it's a bit hard for me to explain as our kind of have to get a feel for it but I'll try and make it as clear as I can. You need your oil (I love coconut oil in a curry personally), your curry powder, a whole sweet yellow onion diced finely and a small cup of warm water or broth. First heat your oil over medium low and add your curry powder directly into it (for a curry making about 7 portions I'd use two tablespoons of curry powder, don't be afraid of it!). The curry powder should start to foam and sizzle a bit, keep cooking it for about two minutes until your whole house reeks and your girlfriend upstairs starts complaining (I think I'm projecting). Now add in your diced sweet onion (the big sweet onions are extra good because they caramelize well), and fry it in the oil spice mix. After a minute or two you'll notice it will start to seem really dry in the pot, so here's where you add a small splash of your warm water and use it to stir up the stuck bits. Keep doing this cycle of letting it get dry and adding a bit of water to stir into it for about 10 min or so until your onion is looking nice and soft and it makes a sort of beautiful onion curry gravy. At this point I'd add ginger and garlic and then whatever ingredients your curry is based on. I find this works very very well with chicken, especially coconut curry chicken. Hope this helps! ", "My dad has had five restaurants (indian) and everyone else in my family can cook a bit \n\nYou can make any curry if you know how to make the base (this isn't the only way but in general)\n\n\nPut a bit of oil in sauce pan and heat (slowly as to not get the oil spitting) add to this chopped onions.

You can add the other cumin seeds or other stuff but  when learning  don't bother \n\nAdd to this a tomato paste or diced tomatoes\n\nAdd in diced chicken breast or chopped whole chicken (this good as juice is given off the bone)\n\nFrom here you can make it what ever curry you want .

I add chickpeas or peas towards the end. I don't usually add coconut milk but if I did I'd put it in before/instead of the tomatoes. I add single cream instead and stir it in five mins before the end to add some body.  ", "So I tend to cook my meat and vegetables and then drop them into a strainer to drain out the excess oil before adding them to the sauce or if that's not available i'll set them on a paper towel for a minute or two.\n\nIf the coconut milk is the issue it's probably cause your cooking the sauce at too high of a heat and it is separating. I've been told to keep cream sauces at a simmer to help prevent that.\n\nCoconut milk and tomato puree/crushed/etc. definitely goes well together. Would be similar to like tikka masala. As far as curries go there are many varieties. I tend to use coconut milk only in Thai curries, Tomatoes and a bit of cream in Indian curries, and just water in Japanese curry. I have no idea how that compares to what they actually do in those regions but it's worked out pretty well for my tastes.", "Don't add ground spices at the start, they will burn. You can add whole spices such as fenugreek, cumin, fennel, mustard seeds etc. at the start into hot oil (a tarka), then add your chopped onions etc. Blitzing the onions compared to chopping gives a different flavour so try both, they're good for different dishes. A dopiaza for example has fried chopped onions at the start then grated onions added later for the flavour. \n\nMy basic curry recipe would be:\n\nHeat oil (usually sunflower, ghee is ideal if you can get it),\n\nAdd whole spices and fry till they sizzle,\n\nFry onion with pinch of salt for about 10 minutes on a low heat\n\nAdd garlic, ginger, chilli paste (I bash it up in mortar and pestle) fry for another minute,\n\nNow add your curry powder (ground spices - basically coriander, cumin, turmeric, chilli powder and whatever else to make the dish unique),\n\nFry for a minute or so on a low heat, then turn the heat right up and add a couple tbsps of water, cook the water off and repeat a few times (this cooks the spices),\n\nMost of the time I marinade my meat and cook it separately (usually grilled chicken, I don't really eat lamb or beef) but now would be the time to add meat otherwise. Lamb can be added much earlier, with the onions, because the fat will cook off and make the sauce.\n\nAlternatively you can add chick peas, vegetables etc. at this point. \n\nAnyway, seal the meat then add a tin of tomatoes (or more depending how many it's serving), cook this down a bit then add some water and continue reducing until it's where you want. \n\nIf you're using chicken, it's best to seal it at the start, take it out of the pan, then continue with onions etc. and add it back nearer the end. Otherwise it will overcook while you reduce the sauce.\n\nOlive oil is too highly flavoured in my opinion, and you only need a tbsp or two of oil. Might be why it's greasy?\n\nPersonally I can find coconut curry a bit sickly after a while, and I never use cream. Coconut I will use in a south Indian fish or prawn curry with plenty of fresh lime to counterbalance it. Otherwise tomatoes or sometimes just water (got a very nice pork vindaloo recipe with over 20 spices and just water and tamarind to make the sauce).\n\nYou can add a bit of tomato paste to help thicken the sauce, and extra flavour, but really just tinned tomatoes is fine.", "I almost always use vegetable oil as my base, sometimes a little sesame oil mixed in too. The greasiness may come as a result of too much olive oil against the vegetables?\n\nI also throw in a generous amount of store-bought curry paste a couple minutes after the vegetables go in, and then after a couple more minutes I'll add a can of coconut milk and my meats if I'm using any. Then I just let everything finish cooking while the coconut milk lightly bubbles and thickens. ", "My only close Indian friend also starts with an oil base and adds spices.\n\nHave you experimented with different sorts of oil?\n\nOlive oil vs Grapeseed oil or canola oil, for instance?", "Thanks for the incredibly detailed procedure.

I\u2019m thinking most of staples like Chicken Tikka/Butter Chicken, Aloo Gobi, palak paneer, etc that you\u2019d find at every restaurant here in the states. \n\nAre those recipes going to be pretty much identical or are there big stylistic variations from UK to the US?", "username": "musicjohnny", "upvotes": 6, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Curry/comments/10mz6vh/bir_recipes_vs_american_versions/", "permalink": "/r/Curry/comments/10mz6vh/bir_recipes_vs_american_versions/", "comments": ["I am not aware of American-style curries.  You are generally going to find the original curry recipe from the Indian subcontinent, or you are going to find BIR style.  Given the relationship between the Indian subcontinent and the British colonization, it is easy to understand why curries became a thing in the UK.  That being said, I believe a lot of BIR style curries are spicier (hotter) than the original, mainly because the restaurants did/currently do employ a large majority of Bangladeshi cooks that prefer a hotter mix.", "I'm no pro on this subject but I have some things to add.  TLDR is at the bottom.  Traditional Indian cooking was done in the home or for big events.  There was no restaurant culture in India until recently.  Unfortunately, this style does not translate well to western restaurants standards so when Indian food landed in Britain they had to adopt the French standard of cooking (mise en plas etc.) to keep up with the speed of individual plate production.  To speed everything up from a 2 hour curry to a 3 minute curry, certain things need to be cooked ahead of time to develop flavor.  This is where \"Curry Bases\" come in.  \n\nAn excellent resource for this is [glebekitchen.com](https://glebekitchen.com) .  Look up his hotel vs restaurant curry base to start.  He has a YouTube channel as well.  \n\nEssentially every restaurant has their own curry base and that base is used to make 10+ dishes on the menu.  Add chicken and cream, you have one dish.  Add spinach and potatoes.  Another.  All still using the same base.  It speeds up the process but also standardized a bunch of dishes in the BIR.  American Indian entrepreneurs used this same curry base strategy.  Now, where they might differ is access to ingredients and the region/religious background they came from.  Outside of that, AIR took BIR's playbook.  Standard Indian dishes in Britain are going to be the same as in America.  However, for some insight, I did a Chicken Tikka Masala tour of London last year and the same dish varied drastically across different regional restaurants.  (Punjabis won by the way, Bengali... not so much). So let's be very clear, there is no \"authentic standard\" in BIR.  There is only great food and bad food and whole lot in the middle. \n\nNow, let's look at the future.  BIR has a problem.  Everyone expects the same food they grew up with.  And they want it cheap.  AIR never really took off so there is lots of room to play around.  Plus, American audiences no longer want the Americanized version of things.  They want the \"Authentic\" version (which is bullshit but whatever).  So new AIR chefs have more room to play.  They can finally cook the food that they like and not have to worry about satisfying a perception of what their food is supposed to be.    I've even seen some second generation Micheline Star chefs shift from American New to Indian make super interesting food that no one would consider \"Indian\" but it's pushing the boundaries of what is possible.  I'm not saying that isn't happening in Britain but it's definitely harder to make that sale.  \n\nTLDR: BIR and AIR has historically been the same thing stylistically.  Some chefs are good cooks, some are bad.  Authenticity is bullshit.  Eat the food you enjoy.  Look up \"Curry Bases\" to get a sense of what BIR and AIR chefs use to make your curries fast.  Things are changing quickly in the Indian food world and it's exciting to witness.", "From my limited experience of US curry restaurants (Colorado only), there is less options, a narrower range of heat, perhaps not made to the same caliber, and the naan bread isn\u2019t as good. \n\nHowever, it is still very, very good and is not dissimilar to what you would find in a BIR.", "BIR are designed to be made fast, and as cheap as fuck.\n\nThey use a base \"gravy\" and pre-cooked meat.\n\nSo they're usually bland and all taste generic as a result.\n\nThey get a strong following, but every BIR fanboi I've served up a proper curry to usually changes their ways pretty quick.", "Check out Al\u2019s kitchen on YouTube.

{"id": "103c0fe", "title": "Pilau rice problem", "body": "My recipe for pilau rice calls for 6 cloves, 6 green cardoman pods, 3 cinnamon sticks, 3 star anise and a teaspoon of cumin seeds to be fried in oil briefly before then adding the rice, water and a tablespoon of turmeric, stirring that in and then simmering for 6 minutes using the absorption method. It makes a great pilau rice and it is foolproof. \n\nThe only problem is I have to fish out all those whole spices before serving it. The cinnamon sticks and star anise are easy but the cloves and cardomon pods are a pain to find and get out of the pot.

They must make pilau rice in big bulk everyday but I cant imagine a chef there fishing out all these spices in even bigger quantities that what I am using.

It usually comes from the butcher prepared this way. Chicken skin is seen as undesirable and dirty. Even many South Asian fried chicken preparations are skinless. Butchers have superior heavy sharp knives than what people tend to have at home, and they are trained in making clean chops in the right places to avoid bony shards and oddly shaped pieces. I\u2019d say your customers just expected that you\u2019d do a more efficient and superior job removing the skin and chopping the bird than what they could do themselves at home.", "I wish I could say that our knives are heavier and sharper but due to how much meat is cut on a daily basis for most grocery stores with actual cutting rooms. It was deemed more cost effective to buy cheaper knives that are easily replaced. These knives are in fact very light plastic handled knives that dull very quickly. As for us doing a better job cutting. Iv seen cutters just chop a chicken very haphazardly out of annoyance with no regard to bone shards. So if that is why they prefer for us to cut it then they are sadly mistaken that chickens chopped up for curry is done with any particular extra skill or care. If I\u2019m being honest with the exception of us skinning the chicken it\u2019s almost better to chop the chicken at home to your preference instead of the hot mess I have seen some cutters produce.", "India food is always been divided by religion,  geography, caste, class. This is something younger( about 40 and less) fail to acknowledge. India is bigger geographically and culturally than Europe and of course by population. \n\nSince population is very high you can get enough people of your caste, religion ethnicity around where you live and even if you move elsewhere you tend to unconsciously interact mostly with your own niche social structure. \n\nUsually when an Indian says ' in India we' 80% of the time he is talking about his family and family friends of same religion, caste and even ethnicity. \n\n Of course being observant and being analytical is not taught at all in indian education system, book reports, analysis, critical analysis even something like speaking in class or journaling are almost never taught in indian schools. \n\nSo Indians tend to forget even things which were predominant facts just a few decades back.\n\nFood is a very big point of conflict in India. Eating in homes of others or in Resturants was taboo for most of the people unless they belonged to your caste and religion and often ethnicity. \n\n95% of Indian people you find on internet and in western countries will belong to top 3-4 upper caste of Hindus.  Muslims 15% , Christians, 2%, lower castes and tribals 23%, outcastes presently called Dalits 25% are not part of the mix most of these 95% urban ,.semi urban, educated Indians.  \n\nRest of the world interacts with and who have similar percentage in media too. However since these people are in numbers of hundreds of millions they constitute a world in themselves. \n\nThe reason for this is elaborate back ground was necessary so readers understand how misinformation prevails  in the minds of Indians whom the world interacts with but is also passed on to the rest of the world.\n\nIndia industrialised very very late. What you had in 1940 ties in terms of food industrialisation India is at that stage now.\n\n\nIn decades back food poverty was extreme in India. \nTill late 70ties getting 100 ml milk daily for kids was challenge to 90% or more Indians..I remember a typical shop would only have one or two dozen eggs to sell and people would buy eggs by one or two for a meal when they wanted. This was typical for even middle class people.\n\n\nTill early 1980 ties 95% or more of the chicken (hen/rooster really as this was 10 month old)  sold in India was purchased live and slaughtered at home.  The breeds were native and slow growing farms , tiny often collected from villagers with small flocks of 50-100 ( till date goat and sheep is still reared this way) \n\n\n\nThe method was slaughter, pluck feathers then use a fire to burn off the fine down which can't be removed by hand . This hen/rooster was low fat and thus skin would not be thick and the meat took almost 3 times the time to cook compared to present day industrial broiler chicken which is only 5 weeks old at slaughter time. \n\nThis all the dishes were loose gravvy dishes and skin roasted to a nice crisp as part of cleaning tasted good.  The Punjabies rich Resturants of Hindu and Sikh in Delhi and couple of  major cities in Punjab invented cooking chicken without skin in the Traditional Tandoor in 1960 ties. Pakistani Punjabis till a couple of decades back had not got this innovation because of the split in nation in 1947. \n\nSkin was till 1980ies considered the most tastiest part of the hen/rooster followed by the neck and legs.  You can't imagine people who can only buy one or two eggs at a time or find 100 ml milk per child a luxury throwing away skin?.\n\n\nIn late 1980ies modern chicken farming became prevalent and the chicken slightly cheaper than regular native hens people took to it , not for taste but for it being cheap , housewifes liked it because it cooked easily.  \n\nEven today 90% of chicken is purchased live from tiny chicken shop they slaughter it in front of you and then clean it up and give it to you. For couple of decades these shops still cleaned the chicken in traditional way pluck and use a fire( typically a kerosene blow torch) to clean the feathers. Only in 1990ties majority of the chicken is skinned when sold. Mainly because with time 2 month old broiler chickens became 5 week old broiler chickens with same weight.  Their skin is thick and rubbery. It doesn't taste very well in curries because they did a quick burn with high heat with a blow torch which cleaned the fuzz but didn't roast the chicken.\n\nMost people who eat chicken today( except from old elites or muslims,)  are from from people who rarely ate chicken just 30-40 years back on regular basis in their families either because of religious taboos or unaffordability. \n\nMost such people do not roast chicken with or without skin in a pan before adding liquids for curry. If you add water and skin boils it's rubberiness will not go no matter how much you cook it in a loose gravvy. \n\nTDLR.; Anyone telling skin was Traditionally not eaten in India or considered unclean is just talking out of his hat and 95% Indians( who ate chicken) till 1980ies ate country chicken slaughtered at home and skin was considered the best part of a chicken.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n \n \n.", "Can confirm, I've had this happen to me multiple times. But given how often we cook chicken curry and how little I trust myself to chop a chicken I still keep going back.\n\nOver time though you will find a butcher who is a bit better than most and will stick to them for buying your meat.", "Well this is a very long and elaborate response, it doesn\u2019t really answer my question as to why they never cut the chicken up at home and only ever have it done at the store. Myself and many others who cook curry at home Prepare our chicken ourselves with very little issues", "For the extra money you spend to have us cut it, after a month or so you could buy a quality kitchen cleaver and a chain mail glove like the ones we use. We aren\u2019t trained to cut the chicken officially it\u2019s just something most of the time they wing it. I\u2019m self taught via YouTube. Believe it or not most stores don\u2019t allow cleavers anymore as they are a liability to \u201cidiots who think swinging  up by your head is a good idea\u201d with a quality cleaver you only need to swing the blade about 8-10 inches above the chicken to cut through the bone with minimum force.

And if they are from India this generation or previous they got to a shop and the butcher slaughters does everything and gives it to you. \nIn families where meat eating was norm and not taboo and affordable why chickens many go slaughter the goats/deer/sheep  skin them and clean up and cut it into big pieces then approach a butcher to cut it in small pieces. A number of my friends in US and Canada do it.  \nHowever amongst upper class/caste Hindus most families don't have experience of handling any kind of meat.

In many cases women cook chicken but have never tasted it in their life.", "This surprisingly irritates me more knowing the facts. My take away is that it\u2019s a couple generations that refuse to learn to do something themselves. It\u2019s not a service any butcher enjoys and often leaves us raging and chopping the meat haphazardly. I\u2019d understand if it was a religious practice of being forbid to handle raw meats etc but simply because it\u2019s what they are used to in their native country doesn\u2019t seem like a good enough reason to slow down a meat department to chop up a chicken.

This curry dish gets its complexity from a host of fragrant ingredients such as ground mustard seed, galangal, ginger, red chillies, shallots, lemongrass, turmeric, and last but not least, vinegar, which added a sharper taste. The end result is a curry dish that is spice-laden, complex in flavor, tantalizing to the taste buds.\n\nKristang cuisine blends the cuisines of Southeast Asia with a western-style cuisine inherited from Portuguese colonial rulers. It is often served one or two days after Christmas and on other special occasions.\n\nIn the original Kristang, \"curry debal\" means \"leftover curry\". This is because, in the old days, this curry was commonly prepared the day after Christmas with leftover meats from the holiday feast. The similarity of the words \"debal\" and \"devil\", probably paired with spiciness of the dish, lead to it being adopted into the English language as \"Devil's Curry\"."], "urlNames": [], "urlLink": [[]]}

In the UK CTM normally contains coconut and almonds and is sweetened with mango chutney and sugar which seems to be a big point of contention outside the UK.

What sort of cuisine are you doing? Thai? Indian? Chicken thighs do not dry out as easily as chicken breast because they have higher fat content. If you are doing a curry cooked slowly I would use thigh meat on the bone.\n\nThe hands down best way to cook chicken breast for Indian food is to marinade it in spices and yoghurt for at least a day and then roast it at a high temperature in a grill, oven or tandoor. The yoghurt seals in the moisture and gives you moist succulent chicken with a great flavour. You can then make up a sauce in a pan and add the precooked chicken to the sauce. This is how Chicken Tikka Masala is made.\n\nAlternatively you can precook the chicken by poaching it in a little stock on a low heat before hand (you can freeze the precooked chicken so long as it is well coated in the freezer). I never fry chicken for curries as it's the easiest way to make it go dry.\n\nWith Thai food I tend to slice the chicken thin, and drop it into the broth right at the end to just poach it. I sometimes marinade it in bicarbonate of soda, msg and salt 15 minutes before which helps it stay tender and maximises the flavour.", "i would choose chicken thighs in nearly every situation. imo they cook/taste better and are more forgiving. also if you cook the thighs still on the bone, the bones will give off great flavour too. only issue with this is that the skin on the thighs can make it more oily so skim it off at the end or add less oil when cooking (or remove the skin before cooking)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: im talking mainly for indian curries, dont know much about thai tbh ", "As comprehensive answer as you will get. I wholeheartedly agree that frying is one of the worst ways too cook chicken for curry type dishes.\n\n(I pause on the idea that yoghurt seals moisture in - that isn\u2019t really the chemistry that it is happening, it\u2019s more than the acid softens the proteins and enables a sort of mesh to appear, and the liquids in yoghurt can enter those pockets. Yoghurt is also great as it\u2019s such a mild acid that it doesn\u2019t have the toughening effect that stronger acids like citric do once marinaded for long enough.)", "Thank you very much for the extensive answer.

I would really recommend not using premade spice mixes for two main reasons; 1) pre-made spice mixes may contain flavours that you may end up disliking in a particular dish but may really enjoy in another. Meaning, that having a pre-made spice blend doesn't give you the freedom to play around with different spices and flavours that would really enhance your experience when you sit down to enjoy your meal. Secondly, spice blends can go bad if not stored properly or used within a certain time frame so when you realize that you don't like said blend you may end up not using it all that much and inadvertently end up tossing it into the garbage. According to the website for the spice blend, it is supposed to be used on goat meat. So I would really just stick to that or use it with meats that have a hearty flavour like goat. For example beef ribs may work in that case. I think the spice blend may just require a meat type that has a lot of grease or juices to keep the spices moist. You can achieve the same result if you cook your tilapia with the same spice blend but instead of pan frying or searing it with the spice blend as your coating on the fish I would suggest wrapping it up in a banana leaf and steaming it with the coating of spice blend and see what happens. Hope this helps. If you have any other questions, PM me.", "Your boyfriend should start on a rogan josh. You should have lots of balti. Also try to discover tamrin sauce..

Now, if I know someone who really just can't handle any heat, how much flavor an i gonna lose if i switch the chilli powder for paprika or something, and leave out the whole peppers? is it gunna ruin the whole dish?", "Thanks, I'll give that a shot as well.", "That sounds like a pretty good idea... how do i steam something in a banana leaf? On the stove in a pan or in the oven? Where do you get banana leaves... I might be a novice... I'm a novice...", "Tamarind fruit sounds like an awesome thing in soo may different cuisines and so many different ways! I have a raita herb mix as well, and I've used that in greek yogurt, which was pretty good over rice, I thik I'd like it with pita bread as well. The curries I'd have to delve further in, and the boyfriend decided I wasn't the right girl for him. Sooo, I don't have anywhere to cook it, back to restaurants!", "Never tried it with paprika... though that sounds like a good idea! The fish is more of a \"sour/fresh\" flavour; coriander seeds, ginger... best to test out recipes/experiments with yourself/family before serving to guests. You could also try a mild smoked pepper, or a sweet pepper for flavour... ", "To steam anything you just need to have a pot or utensil of any kind that can boil water *below* whatever you are steaming so that the boiling water never actually comes in contact with the food. So if you happen to have a rice cooker you could possible steam the fish using the steamer option that came with it (it should be a perforated dish like thing that will sit on top on the rice and the lid closes on top of that. So when the rice cooks, the steam from the rice cooks the fish). Or you could make your own steamer. Use a medium sized sauce pot and fill the bottom two inches with water. Now if you don't have a steaming basket I really suggest that you get one because you can steam many different kinds of vegetables for a quick side for a healthy dinner. Using a steaming basket in the pot with water lay out your fish  (wrapped in a banana leaf) and steam it till you think it is cooked. I don't usually cook tilapia but I have seen the fish being cooked in this manner. It will help retain a lot of the flavour from the spice blend. Also something I forgot to mention in my previous response was that you should invest in whole spices and good air tight jars. Whole spices can be blended into fine powders and different blends according to your taste and they last a lot longer in the pantry too.

My understanding is that Maesri paste is commonly used in Thailand.\n\nThe kaffir lime leaf isn't absolutely necessary but it makes the difference between a decent curry and one that makes you want to do it again...and again.\n\nTo find good coconut milk, shake the can before you buy it.

Of course, before browning the meat( I use lamb) slowly sweat down onion so it's more like a paste. Pro tip - throw in some lamb bones. Cook slow for two hours or so.

The base is still usually something I bought at a store, with the coconut milk already added, rather than homemade.  When I was in Thailand, they seemed to use fresh basil like spinach.  The key is to add the it relatively early, otherwise it dominates too much.  Also, you can never go wrong by adding some fresh cilantro.\n\nDisclaimer:  I'm an Anglo-Canadian, so nothing I make is \"authentic\" - I just know what I like.  :)\n\nEdit:  My secret weapon is fresh (green) peppercorns.  They can sometime be tricky to track down though.  Put them late into the curry, while they're still on the sprig, then pull them out and leave them beside the dish to be used as one wishes. It makes an attractive (as well as tasty) garnish.  They're much milder when green compared to dried, so you can eat them whole.\n\n ", "[deleted]", "Depends on the paste - it should have instructions on it somewhere.

Fresh lime, coriander leaf, and/or holy basil are great garnishes that'll elevate a plate, too.\n\nFood processor is the *quickest way* to mix a paste.

For years I've been occasionally attempting to make it at home, but it never turns out well. I've tried from scratch, the Maesri paste, and more recently the Arroy-D paste. IMHO I have not been able to get close to the flavors I'm after. What is strange to me, is that I've eaten at so many different restaurants around the country (USA) and they all seems to taste very similar. I assume there is some base a lot of thai restaurants use, but for the life of me I can't seem to produce similar results.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on a good recipe to start, or a paste I've yet to find?

I don't have recommendations for specific brands of ingredients, but any brand should do.\n\nI followed this recipe: [https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/142055/chicken-massaman-curry/](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/142055/chicken-massaman-curry/)\n\nI excluded tamarind & lime because i didnt have any. I also added a red pepper because i love it in curries.\n\nI used a red curry paste, from the Asian section of my local grocery store.\n\nOne thing I've learned from trying to cook on my own, **make sure you salt EVERYTHING**. Season your food!! Be generous.  Honestly is the same for other ingredients you add as well.\n\nIt turned out fantastic! A lot closer to my local Thai restaurant than I thought it would be.\n\nI hope this helps you find the taste you're looking for!\n\n&#x200B;", "Sorry I haven't posted sooner. My name is Jum and last year I started a new brand based on my Thai curry paste recipes passed down from my mother and grandmother. I now live in the UK for over 25 years, and have always made my own curry paste. But as the kids have left home, we joked about being able to get mum's paste online, and here we are. \n\nThe paste found in supermarkets have high salt content, which means that by the time you dilute it down to a palatable level you have lost the intensity and heat. Although I didn't do this myself, many of my Thai friends bought the supermarket brands and then added extra herbs and spices to improve the balance. \n\n[My Thai curry paste](https://www.maejum.com/thai-curry-pastes) are not being distributed in the US, but we do sell online and on Amazon UK. Now we have a growing number of restaurants buying our pastes, which is great, even though our pastes are more expensive, but it is traditional, and does have the heat missing from maybe high street brands.  There is nothing more addictive than the vibrant heat of fresh chilli. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour hands may be still be novice, but don't give up because it is attainable, trust me. You just need a good quality coconut milk, I use Aroy-D or Chaokoh, plus follow some simple principals and find a good paste or have a go at making it youself. I have written a couple of blogs which you might find interesting to read (please share). \n\n[About Coconut milk](https://www.maejum.com/blog/busting-the-myths-about-coconut-milk)\n\n[Making the perfect Thai curry](https://www.maejum.com/blog/making-the-perfect-thai-curry)\n\n[Basic Principals of Thai Cooking](https://www.maejum.com/blog/basic-principals-of-thai-cuisine)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "For sure! We moved across country recently, and haven't fully stocked our cupboard, so we've just followed the recipe on the past cans (admittedly they don't add extra ingredients). We always throw in peanuts, and FISH sauce when we have it. In the past we've used recipes from RasaMalaysia and The Very Hungry Cook (we sub chicken and beef with tofu, as we don't eat the former). Do you have recommendations for quality coconut milk? Every different store I go to has several different choices, and I'm not ever sure what I should gravitate for. Thanks for the reply!", "Thanks for the advice, I'll look for the paste, and that recipe you speak of :)", "Thanks for the reply! I'll give this a try.

It turned out really well...while not completely the massaman I'm looking for, it is a good curry.  \n\n\nSimilar to you I had some red curry paste. I also added half a yellow onion, and ended up cutting down the fish sauce by 1/3. I probably could have cut it down further, as the only fish sauce I could find at the store was thick...almost like creamy salad dressing? I've only ever had the very liquidy version in the past.

Oh the horror.\n\nI found it in the [Hamyln All-Colour Indian Cookbook](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hamlyn-All-Colour-Indian-Cookbook/dp/0600574555) that had been handed down to me from siblings, never really thought nothing of it until recently as it's easily my favourite dish and unlike all the others I've made over the years.\n\nIn recent months I've been using Ox cheek exclusively for this one, and extended the cooking times up a couple of hours; it's dirt cheap and just falls apart. It's also good for a slow cooker if that's your bag.\n\nI've used a couple of vinegars for it, but always come back to Malt Vinegar as it just makes it really tart.\n\nAlthough I don't have the book to hand, the following sites are pretty much the same recipe;\n\n* [Recipe one](http://easy.betterrecipes.com/beef-buffad.html)\n* [Recipe two](http://jasnaskitchencreations.blogspot.com/2013/06/beef-buffad.html)\n* [Recipe three](http://worldbestbeefrecipes.blogspot.com/2015/04/beef-buffad.html)\n\nSearching around I can't really find anything about its origins, not that I especially expect to, I've no idea what 'Buffad' is, whether it's a style, a region, or even a person's name. I have no idea of its linguistic origins either. My Google-fu just draws a blank.\n\nThere's a couple of things I find interesting about this dish;\n\n* It uses beef - unusual for curries of Hindu origin, which makes me think of either a Muslim or Christian influence\n* It uses vinegar - this just reminds me of Vindaloo marinades\n\nI was under the impression that Vindaloo was a derivative of the Portuguese dish [Carne de vinha d'alhos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carne_de_vinha_d%27alhos) and I'd seen a couple of other Goan dishes that use beef. For this reason I'm leaning towards this being a Goan dish, but by no means am I an expert - I just make and eat the stuff.\n\nProbably most of you are thinking \"Who cares where it's from?\", and I guess that's the important thing here, making & eating curry.
