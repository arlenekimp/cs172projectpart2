I can\u2019t stand by and let animals be abused and murdered for taste pleasure when it\u2019s entirely healthy to eat completely plant based (the American dietetic association says).", "That\u2019s fine I don\u2019t care about downvotes", "Okay thanks for chiming in. I think talking about animal abuse with those who abuse animals would mean it\u2019s probably the right place. I wouldn\u2019t ask someone who doesn\u2019t believe in the problem how to best advocate for fixing the problem. I wouldn\u2019t ask a racist how to fix racism. It\u2019s easy to anger when people don\u2019t care about abusing and murdering animals every day and not cause about the victims if it gives them a nice taste pleasure. Would you tell a Black Lives Matter activist to stop being angry or a feminist. But yes people usually respond worse to accusations or anger", "As I have already said I do not eat much meat and almost all of the animal products I do eat are literally being saved from being thrown in the trash. Perhaps thank me for contributing to lessening to landfills/pollution etc?", "I knew all of this information and I agree that it's horrific, you'd be hard pressed to find someone who disagrees and anyone who does disagree is not someone who I care to converse with. To be frank, you aren't going to convert people by commenting on Reddit posts", "Who's abusing the animals in this sub? How do you know?", "It\u2019s great to avoid food waste. The animals lives are still ended horribly ideally it would be all plant based food but for now eating food going to be thrown out if that\u2019s what is given out is fine. We can only control so much. As long as we don\u2019t pay for any animal abuse we are doing what we can", "Possibly not, possibly it adds up just a tiny bit to them changing their mind on it being justified to abuse animals for taste pleasure. Or just for them to realize it\u2019s unnecessary. So sharing meals, facts about animal ag, all that stuff seems helpful. Idk even if it didn\u2019t do anything I\u2019d still try to help prevent needless suffering. I can\u2019t help myself from speaking up. Definitely makes me less popular haha. But yes In person activism and education it just passive activism from seeing good health etc is also beneficial. Thanks for the conversation. Hope you have a good night.", "Ending lives unnecessarily is abuse to the victim, regardless of treatment for one. And often there is lots of pain and suffering in fishing and aquaculture", "We are not done here, I would like for you to acknowledge that racism and homophobia didn't have a single thing to do with this", "And yet here you are, supporting a seafood sub by commenting and giving it more exposure. Adding to the spread of your so claimed abuse. But even more so, how did you know that person abuses any animals before you decided to lecture them? You are doing a lot of assuming.", "Yes racism and homophobia have nothing to do with you or this seafood page. I only mentioned it because you told me people can just ignore this page (so I brought up other injustices we both would fight for and not ignore). And like those other injustices I cant just ignore animal abuse. It popped up in my page so I thought I\u2019d make a comment or two. I imagine most people here would not support dog fighting or eat dogs or cats but unfortunately to a lot of people, most other animals are fair to abuse if you eat their secretions or dead bodies afterwards", "They commented I need this to this post of a dead fish. I think it\u2019s fair to assume they eat animals. Protesting a group or post does not support the group. Protesting McDonald\u2019s and airing it on tv talking about the issues would give McDonald\u2019s exposure but bad exposure, which would hopefully reduce demands and changed people\u2019s minds about supporting them. Sort of like this. It could draw more people to see this post but then they see someone bashing it and maybe someone questions if it is really necessary or justified to kill animals like that", "The person I initially replied to is not vegan, check his profile, he is literally just being a cunt. That's why animal abuse, racism, and homophobia have nothing to do with this post", "This isn't some McDonald's campaign. All people are going to do is see that the post has more comments and that it's in the way to the front page. Sorry to burst your bubble, but being mean and trying to guilt trip people on some persons personal post isn't going to get you any results that you want. You, again, are not doing any justice by assuming things. How about ask someone before you accuse them? It's basic manners they teach you in elementary school. You know, cause and effect? That sort of thing.", "Okay. I\u2019m only seeing the posts being replied to me I\u2019ll check the whole thread", "Hey sorry for attacking you earlier. As you can see I get very passionate about animal rights but have not learned effective debate skills and conflict free discussion practice. I aim to work on that and hopefully will be better able to discuss the issue. We can all contribute to solving the issue by stopping the demand for the product or the action like going out and fishing. I\u2019ll take away what you told me about not assuming about people and have a much less aggressive style, rather share some information. I\u2019m going to start my own YouTube channel to try to bring about some change in people\u2019s minds. Thanks for being one of my first discussions. I learned I need to work on a lot", "I didn\u2019t assume he was an animal abuser. The poster shared a dead animal they were going to eat as well as the person talking with me earlier said they wanted some, meaning they would be happy to support murdering fish. And  for you I would not assume are against animal abuse until you bash me for speaking up against animal abuse so it\u2019s obvious you are not an ally for the animals. Also your profile shares meals with eggs and pig flesh\u2026 so would it not be fair to realize you support animal cruelty?", "Here is another question would you bash someone speaking up against pedophilia or some other issue? No probably not even if people were being aggressive and rude. It\u2019s just because it\u2019s socially acceptable and you yourself probably contribute to the problem that you are telling me I\u2019m being an ass hole and ineffective", "Understood, thanks for being civil", "Again you assume. Just because I speak about against YOU, does not mean I don't support animals. I can very much dislike you, the fallacies you create in am argument, the way you guilt trip people, and the amount of times you assume, while still supporting animals. So now you are creating animosity between those that would support you by creating ultimatums against those that disagree with you and your arguments, not the animals.", "I would speak against them if they were using multiple fallacies in their arguments, which is the original reason I spoke against you. I had no argument for or against animals, only an arguments opposing your fallacies and approach to arguments.", "Okay well maybe in shit at convincing people. Maybe not I had a few people engage me and start making excuses so they know on some level it\u2019s better to not harm animals, which they are doing. You should do it yourself then if you care about animals. And that would definitely mean not supporting purchasing their dead bodies (so the supermarkets don\u2019t kill more to replace them) and secretions", "So you would respond to anyone you view as having bad arguments not for the content? It wasn\u2019t because you dislike my message or that I\u2019m essentially calling you out for being an animal abuser and not stopping?", ">Okay well maybe in shit at convincing people\n\nYou are quite shit  at convincing people. I recommend finding some literature on arguments and persuasion.", "That's exactly the point I've been trying to make. I'm glad you are finally understanding.", "Yes I do plan to educate myself and practice at that.", "I honestly think you are just annoyed that I\u2019m calling out animal abuse causing actions which you cause but who knows maybe next time if someone has great arguments you would change your mind.", "Thank you. And try to refrain from ad hominem next time. It's in poor taste and will convince others that you are not trying to convince them of anything, only agitate people and anger them.", "I have no opinion to give on the topic of animal abuse to you. I have no interest in debating the topic with you, whether for or against. I'm not annoyed with the fact that you are calling out animal abuse. I'm annoyed with your lack of debate and argument sense and are only attacking the person and using hypothetical questions to try and pursue am avenue in which to grasp on to your victims conscience.", "Okay. And please consider the victims of your food choices when you go to the grocery stores. Male chickens are useless and die in egg industry , dairy males same thing, and females and used and abused until death", "Okay well that\u2019s fair thanks for the suggestions. I\u2019ll do some more research so I can be a more effective debater to help save more animals. Getting angry and not being able to converse well at all won\u2019t help me either", "Got it.", "Keep at it. I recommend coming to a resolution with those you've used ad hominem on in this sub.", "Thanks. I just started so am just really angry and attack people\u2019s choices but so far it hasn\u2019t led to much.

Couldn\u2019t find the Zatarans seasonings packet but I followed the rest of the methods and recipes. We did 8 dungeness, 5 red rock crab, bought local clams, shrimp, red potatoes, corn, mushrooms. I followed the soaking method and added everything in order of cook time and it all turned out perfectly cooked. At the end I melted butter, added a cup of the broth, parsley and old bay and drizzled that over the top of everything. It was amazing!", "Thank you u/deadduncanidaho!!", "you can get the pouches on amazon: [https://www.amazon.com/Zatarains-Crab-Boil-Six-Bags/dp/B005YQ9IKS](https://www.amazon.com/Zatarains-Crab-Boil-Six-Bags/dp/B005YQ9IKS)\n\nOr you can make your own.  Brown mustard seed, coriander seed, cayenne pepper, bay leaves, dill seed, and allspice.  You can just toss it in without the bag or put it in cheesecloth.", "The photographs of your boil look absolutely amazing.  Your presentation is genuine Louisiana seafood boil and at the same time very uniquely Oregon.  I love the paper bags on the table.  We should adopt that in New Orleans. (Our newspapers are for the most part gone, but everyone has paper bags from the uppity stores.) \n\n10 out of 10 on presentation\n\nYour shrimp look perfectly cooked, almost as if they would peel themselves.  I don't see any shrimp heads which is unfortunate. Then there is the corn.  It looks perfect with just the right hint of seasons in the nooks and crannies.  The red potatoes look firm on the outside, slightly swollen, hiding a mild reprieve from all that is spicy.  And do I see chunks of kielbasa?  Nice touch.\n\n10 out of 10 on method\n\nThe rest is hard for me to judge, I have never had live boiled dungies.  I really wanted to try it last year when i was in Seattle, but it was not to be.  Quality clams and mussels are not easy to acquire in new orleans so they are not common boil additions.  How ever they look tasty and I am curious to try myself.\n\n10 out of 10 on originality.\n\nTotal score: Perfect 10/10", "Glad to help.  Looks amazing.", "Yeah that was my plan for future boils. Now that I bought a pot with a strainer I\u2019ll be doing a crawfish boil this summer when they\u2019re in season and I\u2019ll be buying the stuff off Amazon. I had to hunt down the zatarans flavoring liquid too so I\u2019ll just order it and have it on hand. Just didn\u2019t have the time to do that this time.", "If you tell me what size pot (in quarts) I can give you a more accurate recipe, or at least tell you how we do it in new orleans.  Now that you got the technique down you can start experimenting with different extras like brussel sprouts, asparagus,  sweet potatoes, and well anything else you want to try.\n\nLouisiana brand has also come out with a line of flavor bags that are fun too.  We have tried this one.  [https://louisianafishfry.com/products/herbal-overload-boil-booster/](https://louisianafishfry.com/products/herbal-overload-boil-booster/)   You do everything normal and then add the bag before putting in the goods.\n\nWhen i do crawfish I like to split it up to multiple boils.  Between batches I add more spice and salt.  The last batch is for the diehards.", "It\u2019s a 24 quart pot and basket. Ive been to New Orleans 3 Times so that is always the the goal, my favorite so far has been Smittys in Kenner. I like the sprouts idea! And I am one of the die hard for the spice so I love that idea. We actually had to do this boil in 2 batches because the crabs were too big", "A 24qt turkey fryer is kind of a tricky size.  I bought one in exile after katrina but mostly cooked shrimp in it.\n\nI would start with these proportions:  1/2 pot of water (3 gallons), 2 season bags, 3 oz liquid (volume), and 3 oz dry (weight), and 3 oz salt (weight) on the first batch.  For each additional batch I would add 1.5 oz liquid, 1.5 oz of dry, and 1.5 oz of salt.\n\nTo derive these estimates I took the amount that I use for my 96 quart pot and scaled down to your pot.  Then I took the recipe that I use for small batches on the stove top and scaled those up to the size of your pot.  My experience says that the big pot recipe scaled down is too weak and the small pot scaled up is too strong.  So i split the difference to come up with something that should have enough flavored water to handle the volume of seafood the pot can hold.\n\nI tend to fill my big pots about half way with water.  Too much water and you need more season, to little and they wont hold enough heat when adding ice cold seafood.  Lastly your pot will hold what it will hold so don't try to over stuff it.  The seafood needs to have room to move about in the water.  For almost everything just boil it until it floats, and then soak it until it sinks.\n\nPS: While i was typing this i was reminded of a friend who brought an ice chest full of shrimp to a lake house in northern Mississippi.  For whatever reason they did not have a big enough pot to cook the shrimp in.  So what they did was made batches of warm seasoned water and filled an ice chest half way with the water.  Then they cooked the shrimp in plain water using a pasta pot with strainer in small batches.  Each batch was dumped in the cooler to soak.  So this might be an option for you if you want to present a bigger batch of seafood at one time such as a crawfish boil.", "Wow I really appreciate all the effort and time you put into this! I may just have to get a bigger pot when it comes time! Thank you so much for all the help and tips & tricks!

Add chili flakes, some salt and pepper, and garlic. \n\nAfter a minute, add the chopped tomato, and let simmer for a few minutes until soft. Next add your clams and wine, bring temp to med high and when the mix starts to simmer, cover for about 5 min give or take- until all the clams open. Then uncover and let simmer a few more min for the alcohol to cook off.\n\nIn the meantime, boil your water but time your pasta to finish cooking closer to when your sauce cooks through, and make sure to cook it about 1 minute less than desired consistency. When ready, scoop about a half cup of pasta water into the mussel sauce, and then add the pasta so it finishes cooking in the sauce for about a minute. Finish with a little butter if using and parsley, toss together and enjoy!\n\nNote: you can omit the bacon and tomato too if you like.\n\nHope you guys try it out, it's pretty simple and delicious!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nu/Marketpro4k  u/catblep u/colinwilkins41\n\n\n*Edit to add, this for 2 portions.

It looks, smells and tastes pleasing, and for good reasons too! Kam Heong (\u7518\u9999), literally means \"sweet fragrance\" in Cantonese, is a culinary cooking style that was developed in Malaysia - heavily influenced by the cultural diversity of Malaysia.\r  \n\r  \nThe making of Kam Heong Crab primarily involves mixing a variety of local spices and sauces that produces a mouth-watering taste when stir-fried with crabs. Ingredients such as crushed dried shrimps, garlic, onions, oyster sauce would be enough to create a mouth-watering flavour on their own, but the addition of curry powder, curry leaves and bird's eye chillies surely adds another layer of Malaysian flair and extra kicks to the dish. The blend of these aromatic ingredients with the famous Chinese hot wok style stir-frying allowed wonderful fragrance to be released during the cooking process. Reflecting back on the name again, it really is no surprise that the dish is referred to as the \"sweet fragrance\".\r  \n\r  \nKam Heong in Cantonese also sounds exactly like \u91d1\u9999 or \u201cgolden fragrance\u201d. Either way, both names are equally suitable to describe the delicious dish.\r  \n\r  \nKam Heong cooking style itself popular enough to provide even more cooking choices. Crab dishes aside, you\u2019ll find that Kam Heong clams, squids, prawns or chicken dishes or even the special Kam Heong fried noodles. are all well-loved by our local foodies and tourists alike.

Here is a tip for you.\n\nIf the crabs are muddy wash them down in the basket and then put them in a cooler with some ice on top of them.  pull the drain plug to make sure that no water accumulates.  You can keep crabs like this for two days before boiling if they are alive when put on ice.\n\nWhen the water is well seasoned and at a rapid boil, add the crabs as quickly as you can by hand.  They will be sound asleep and will not bother you in any way.  Since they are asleep they will not drop their claws.  Keep the heat high until the water boils again.  When the crabs all float to the top kill the fire and let them soak until they sink.  You can put the crabs in a clean cooler to keep them warm.  Stack them upside down to keep the juices and heat in.\n\nI hope this helps you.", "yea we used to do that.  It became a hassle so we just dump away.", "Oh yea!

Just check the label carefully.\n\n\\- For palm sugar, we need the light golden one, not the darker version.\n\n\\- Make more sauce and keep in the fridge for months!\n\n\\- You can substitute shrimp with chicken too.\n\n**STEPS:**\n\n**1. Preparing Pad Thai Sauce:**\n\n\\- Soak tamarind pulp in hot water. Stir and let sit for 20 mins. Strain and set aside.\n\n\\- Shave palm sugar disk, add to a sauce pan under low heat, stir.\n\n\\- When it is slightly caramelized, add tamarind mixture, continue to stir until dissolved then turn off the heat. Add fish sauce, mix and set aside.\n\n\\- Taste: a balance of sweet, sour, and salty.\n\n**2. Cooking Pad Thai:**\n\n\\- Soak dried noodle in cold water for at least 1 hour\n\n\\- Chop chives and tofu into 4cm length sticks\n\n\\- Roughly chop shallot, finely mince garlic\n\n\\- Finely chop sweet preserved radish.\n\n\\- Crush peanuts into medium chunks\n\n\\- Cut some lime wedges\n\n\\- In a large pan under medium heat, add 3 tbs of oil, fry shrimp until cooked, set aside.\n\n\\- Add shallot and garlic, fry until fragrant then add tofu, dried shrimp and preserved radish.\n\n\\- Add drained rice noodle and a little bit of water. Cook until soft then add sauce and mix.\n\n\\- Push the noodles to one side, add oil, crack 2 eggs\n\n\\- Break the yolks, spread them out and move the noodles on top of the eggs. Mix well.\n\n\\- Turn off the heat, add chives and beansprouts. Mix and let them cook in the remaining heat.\n\n\\- Add crushed peanuts, chili flakes to taste, and shrimps back.\n\n\\- Serve hot, garnish with extra bean sprouts, chives, lime wedges, some chili flakes, a little bit of sugar.

On top of all that sprinkle just a lil bit of starch.

Get your wok really nice and hot, lil bit of oil in, and put the seafood first. It will cook really quick, about a minute and a half, make sure to stir. Take it out and put it in a bowl, lil bit more oil, and in go the mushrooms and broccoli. Stir them for about a minute, then ad a few drops of mirin, the garlic comes in now as well, stir stir stir. It\u2019s going to smell really nice. Add the seafood back in, mix well, now, one table spoon of soy sauce and one table spoon of oyster sauce. Mix it vigorously, if you have good technique, do that wok toss thing. Optional you can ad just a teaspoon of water mixed with starch. It will thicken the sauce, make it a bit jelly like.

Let it cool, strain, and store in fridge or freezer.\n\nEdit: we do make a dish called crawfish bisque that uses the outer shells of the heads as a container for stuffing.

Sometimes it is called just Ikan Bakar or Ikan Panggang. In English, the name translates to \u201cgrilled fish (in sambal)\u201d. Although many different types of fish are used for grilling, the most popular fish used in Ikan Bakar Sambal is stingray. Stingray is a very unusual fish, but its tender texture and boneless anatomy made it the perfect choice for this dish.\r  \n\r  \nIkan Bakar Sambal is considered to be a Eurasian dish created in Malaysia during the 1600s, when the Portuguese traders visited the region, and brought their spices and cooking methods. There is another similar version of Ikan Bakar Sambal called the Ikan Bakar Portugis (Portuguese-style Grilled Fish). In that version, the fish is baked in an aluminium foil pouch instead.\r  \n\r  \nTo make Ikan Bakar Sambal, the fin or wing of stingray is used. It is then coated in a flavourful sambal paste, which is made from chilli, turmeric, shallots, garlic, turmeric powder, fermented shrimp paste and lemongrass. However, the sambal paste often varies from region to region and even vendor to vendor. Sometimes, you may find the inclusion of tamarind, peanuts, onions, galangal, sugar or Chinese parsley in the paste.\r  \n\r  \nThe stingray is then wrapped in a banana leaf and grilled on a charcoal fire until cooked. Finally, the fish is removed from the wrapping before topped with some spring onions and served with some special sauces and lemon or lime for an optional dash of freshness. The result is a dish that packs a punch with its wonderful layers of texture, flavours and fragrances.\r  \n\r  \nIkan Bakar Sambal is best eaten on its own or with white rice. Nowadays it has become one of the most popular dishes in Malaysia and also Singapore, especially in hawker centres and seafood restaurants."], "urlNames": [], "urlLink": [[]]}

Spices: Hot paprika, as much as you feel, I got 2 table spoons, garlic powder, 2-3 tablespoons, smoked paprika! one tablespoon, it gives an incredible aroma! and some salt to taste! Now the tricky part. I used a very cold beer. Some ppl use sparkling water (club soda) I prefer beer for extra taste. Pour a lil bit and start stirring, add more keep stirring. It will get all clumpy, that is normal ! Add more beer and stir, patiently, until you reach this gooey consistency, not too liquid but certainly not solid. Don\u2019t over do it with the beer! You don\u2019t want it too liquid !! \nThe shrimp, medium to large size, de shelled but keep the head on! Trust me, the head is full of flavor! I trim the little legs under the head with scissors and try to remove that very sharp spike on top. Smaller shrimp don\u2019t really have one but on the larger shrimp that spike is really sharp. \nI must emphasize that the beer used must be really cold and once you got your batter done get on with cooking, so it won\u2019t get warm. \nOil in, I use a wok, doesn\u2019t really matter, sunflower oil is most popular in my country, get it up to at least 170 degrees celsius (340 Fahrenheit). Drench the shrimp in the batter, a maximum of 4 pieces at once. This is very important to NOT have the oil temp drop substantially. Shrimp will fry fast, about 3 min depending on oil temp. Leave it longer if you feel it isn\u2019t crunchy enough. What I do is check how crunchy the head is, just touch it. It will also change color, going towards a golden shade. Remove on a paper towel, let it rest for 2-3 min and enjoy right away. It will get soggy if left more than 10 min. I used a garlic chilly sauce. It\u2019s really good. Feel free to bite into the head! It\u2019s really really good!", "Sunflowers are not just part of your garden, they\u2019re part of a nation! The Ukraine use the sunflower as their national flower.
