You have to mix it quite quick. \n\nSweet and sour balls - Jar of sweet and sour sauce. Favourite vegan chicken chunk/ball. Batter for approx 350g of chicken. 100g self raising flour, 1 tbsp veg oil mixed in a bowl. Then slowly add water while mixing until you get a gloopy batter consistency. Mix the chicken in the batter and make sure thoroughly coated. Deep fry in batches so you don't overcrowd the pan. Oil at 180\u00b0c. Fry batches until almost done (golden). Then fry all together for a minute or two to finish.\n\nChicken curry - We (UK) use a curry sauce powder called Mayfair. If this isn't available just use what you can find. Make the sauce as per instructions. While sauce is warming fry a diced white onion, 3 or 4 quartered mushrooms and your vegan chicken of choice (or tofu puffs) in some veg oil with a sprinkle of chinese 5 spice and garlic powder (you can use fresh garlic if you prefer). Once they're nearly done add a handful of frozen garden peas. Mix with the sauce and cook for a further minute or two.\n\nBeef chow mein - Boil/prepare your noodles of choice. While the noodles are doing their thing fry your vegan beef of choice (about 100g) in some veg oil with 2 or 3 tsp of dark soy sauce. Mix the soy sauce and beef so it's covered well and then let it sit in the pan for a minute or so to brown a bit before stirring. After about 4 mins add some sliced white onion. After another couple of mins add your noodles to the pan and fry for a couple of minutes (if you like the noodles to look dark you can add a splash of dark soy sauce here). Add a handful or two of bean sprouts and some sliced spring onion (scallion). I added a packet of chow mein sauce at this point but you can either have it dry or make your own sauce using dark soy sauce and cornstarch or potato starch to thicken it. \n\nSpring rolls - We cheated and just used frozen store bought spring rolls. We cooked them in the air fryer to make them extra crispy and avoid them going soggy.\n\nChips - The secret here is an air fryer. Use some frozen chunky chips with a tablespoon of veg oil and fry in the air fryer for about 20 mins until golden.\n\nEnjoy.", "What type of chicken chunk did you use to make the balls?

It doesn\u2019t mean my empathy doesn\u2019t extend to all living beings and it doesn\u2019t mean I think I\u2019m above anyone or any animal.\n\nAnd I\u2019m on this sub not because I\u2019ve subscribed to your specific Ideology of Veganism but because I want more information and a positive vegan community and delicious recipes and general tips on how to be better about how I interact with the world and what food I consume. And no, not everyone on this subreddit is 100% vegan. But if it\u2019s an all-or-nothing situation and I\u2019m not allowed to be here then I\u2019m happy to just fuck off. Doesn\u2019t bode well for your movement though.", "Okay. Think about this logically. Who is going to frequent a sub about vegan food? Vegans, people interested in veganism, and trolls. What purpose does a caption referencing rape and torture serve? Vegans are already aware of it. Potential vegans would, I'm guessing, be turned off by it, because honestly who wants to think about rape and torture when they're looking at pictures of food. And trolls would get off on it. So fine. If you're a vegan who is so precariously balanced on the scale of veganism or non-veganism that you need to remind yourself about the horrors of factory farming multiple times a day, go for it. But please, let me look at pictures of delicious vegan food without bringing rape and torture into it.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m in no way shaming you for your choice to call it rape and I\u2019ve been very intentional to remain respectful, so I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re accusing me of shaming you. I understand that language is complex and that we\u2019re all figuring it out as we go along and I assure you I\u2019m constantly researching and challenging my own viewpoint. You\u2019re the one questioning why I\u2019m on this sub if I don\u2019t 100% think what you do? I\u2019ve never seen any language like this post in this sub so I was taken aback by it and when I (very quickly) expressed my confusion I was downvoted. I questioned the downvotes, but certainly not because I\u2019m angry (??), and here we are.\n\nAnd yeah, this perspective has and will alienate people, even if your movement continues to grow and even if you don\u2019t personally see it happening. You can think what you want and use whatever language you find fitting but all I\u2019m saying is it will have unintended consequences.\n\nEdit/PS: Just so you know, I\u2019ll read any other responses but I don\u2019t plan on commenting any further. I don\u2019t have an answer for you yet and any productive conversation about this topic is certainly not going to happen online. Too much is lost or misinterpreted on Reddit.", "I'm tired of discussing this with you. It's possible I'm not getting my point across. In case I haven't, here it goes again. I agree that factory farming is awful. I agree that veganism is the answer. I do not agree that using words like Rape and Abuse in a sub for vegan food does absolutely any good whatsoever. The person who made the top comment said absolutely nothing about veganism. That was you, that was 100% you.", "[deleted]", "Cool.", "Boom got em"], "urlNames": [{"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}], "urlLink": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], ["https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LQRAfJyEsko"], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]}

From the Herbivorous Butcher in Minneapolis, MN. Pastrami, capicola ham, pepperoni, mozzarella, arugula, cherry pepper relish, garlic mayo and red wine vinegar. I am visiting my BIL and his wife for the weekend and they are vegan. We always go to restaurants that offer options for them and also my wife & I who are not vegan. They love to share and I am never one to turn anything down. I don't think I havent had anything I didn't like except the green bean casserole at Thanksgiving but even they didnt like it due to using a v cream cheese they had never used before. \n\nAnyways, this was my first trip to a vegan butcher and it was amazing! So many different types of meats and cheeses, from korean short ribs & filet mignons to fresh mozzarella and an alfredo sauce. I decided to fully immerse myself since I LOVE Italian hoagies and i was glad i did! No it wasnt 1:1 but it was delicious standing on it's own and I would certainly get it again and keep my eye out to try new sandwiches.

When we last visited in September, we grabbed lunch from there & went to the U of M apple orchard to have our sandwiches with some Sweet Tangos \u2014 best lunch ever.\n\nI like their bacon and ribs a lot too.

These are usually packed full of butter and eggs, but aquafaba is a magical substance.\n\nI kinda picked apart some different recipes that looked good to me:\n\nShortcrust pastry from this recipe: https://domesticgothess.com/blog/2019/07/27/blueberry-frangipane-tarts-vegan/\n\nI used all vodka in the pastry for the first time, and it turned out phenomenally. Highly recommend. It helps you achieve a flakier, lighter crust, and the vodka prevents gluten development (where water would stimulate it, and give you a firmer crumb). I also used all unrefined coconut oil, and it worked out just fine and lent a nice coconut scent/flavor to the pastry.\n\nUsed School Night Vegan's frangipane recipe: https://schoolnightvegan.com/home/vegan-frangipane-tarts/\n\nI think whipping up the aquafaba really helps give you a glossier, non-grainy texture for the frangipane. Adding a small amount of baking powder helps it rise ever so slightly, to closely mimic how an egg-based frangipane would react in the oven.\n\nYou really can use practically any seasonal fruit. I had a craving for peaches, they're absolutely perfect this time of the year, and although I live in Chicago now I had a bunch of Georgia peaches and peach jam mailed to me (yes they're that good).\n\nThese were brought in to work with me, and my non-vegan coworkers absolutely loved them!", "Looks amazing", "Recipe please?", "Looks amazing", "Mouthwatering tart.

Do not skip this step).  \n\u25a2  \nThe dough should be divided into four portions. Roll one portion into a ball. You will need to press the ball between your palms to form a disc 0.5 inches thick (see video for visual aid). You can adjust the thickness to your preference. Wet your fingers with water and gently pat along the edge if it cracks on the sides.  \n\u25a2  \nSpray a bit of oil in a large non-stick skillet and heat on medium heat.

Add the gram flour and 2 tbsp water (a little at a time) to make a thin paste - this will help the tofu come out crispy\n4. If you're using food coloring, add it in last and give it a good mix.

Preheat oven at 350\u00ba\n2. Curdle the milk by combining the unsweetened almond milk and 1 tbsp vinegar, set aside. \n3. Mix all the the dry ingredients into a large bowl and set aside\n4. Start on the wet ingredients by mashing the banana - I used my stand mixer with the whisk attachment to make sure it was completely smooth\n5. With the paddle attachment on, add in the syrup, applesauce, vanilla, and curdled milk to the banana. Mix well for about 1 minute\n6. Slowly add in the dry ingredients and mix until well combined (about halfway through, scrape down the sides to make sure you get all of the mixture)\n7. While the mixer is still on, add in the boiling water. This will make the batter runny and that's okay - that's what we want. \n8. Transfer to your nonstick bundt pan and bake for 50-55 minutes\n\nLet cake cool for about half hr before transferring to a cooling rack and another half hr before frosting your cake. \n\n**For the ganache frosting:** \n\nHeat up 2/3 cup of coconut milk and whisk in 1 1/2 cups of vegan chocolate chips - whisk until smooth. \n\n**How to frost your cake:** \n\nAgain, it's a personal preference. I chose to cover the entire cake with the ganache, but you can take a spoon and just lightly drizzle the ganache over.", "For anyone making this, I personally recommend valrhona cocoa powder (Amazon or Walmart or Whole Foods)!

In 2022, with living costs at an all time high, this is the chocolate cake we all need! This depression cake is so chocolatey, you won't believe it has no eggs, no milk and no butter in it! Even the chocolate icing is dairy free and vegan friendly!\r  \n\r  \nIf you're a visual learner, you can watch my recipe video here, which includes a few additional tips! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGH2ZRPBtCw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGH2ZRPBtCw) \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r\\-----\r  \n**INGREDIENTS**\r  \n\r  \n**Chocolate Cake**\r  \n180g (1 1/2 cups) plain or all-purpose flour\r  \n198g (1 cup) granulated sugar\r  \n6g (1 tsp.) baking soda (or bicarbonate soda)\r  \n3g (1/2 tsp.) salt\r  \n40g (1/3 cup) cocoa powder\r  \n80ml (1/3 cup) vegetable oil (or other neutral cooking oil)\r  \n15ml (1 tbsp.) apple cider vinegar (or other light vinegar such as white vinegar or rice vinegar)\r  \n5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract\r  \n236ml (1 cup) water\r  \n\n\n**Chocolate Icing**\r  \n170g (1 1/2 cups) icing sugar (also known as powdered sugar)\r  \n30g (1/4 cup) cocoa powder\r  \n45ml (3 tbsp.) water\r  \n5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract\r  \n\r  \n\\-----\r  \n\r  \n\r**Method**\r  \n\r  \n1. Preheat your oven to 180C | 350F and line an 8\u201d square pan with parchment paper.\r  \n\r  \n2. To a mixing bowl add 180g (1 1/2 cups) plain or all-purpose flour, 198g (1 cup) granulated sugar, 3g (1/2 tsp.) salt, 6g (1 tsp.) baking soda (or bicarbonate soda) and 40g (1/3 cup) cocoa powder. Whisk this together until thoroughly combined and the mixture is uniform in colour.\r  \n\r  \n3. To 236ml (1 cup) water add 15ml (1 tbsp.) apple cider vinegar (or alternative light vinegar) and 5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract. Just give that a little stir!\r  \n\r  \n4. Add your water-vinegar liquid to the dry ingredients, along with 80ml (1/3 cup) vegetable oil (or other neutral cooking oil). **Mix this quickly**. You want to get this batter into the oven as fast as possible in order to achieve the best rise! A few lumps in the batter is fine, but try to get as much of the flour mixture combined as possible.\r  \n\r  \n5. Pour your deliciously chocolate cake batter into your prepared pan and bake for 30-35 minutes.\r  \n\r  \n6. Now onto the vegan chocolate icing! To a mixing bowl add 170g (1 1/2 cups) icing sugar (also known as powdered sugar) and 30g (1/4 cup) cocoa powder. Mix these ingredients together and then add 5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract.\r  \n\r  \n7. Add in water, one tablespoon at a time. I used 45ml (3 tbsp.) for the perfect consistency. Your icing should be thick enough to remain on your cake, but thin enough to spread easily.\r  \n\r  \n8. Remove your cake from the oven, let it cool to room temperature, spread your chocolate icing over the top and let the icing set. If you want to dress your cake up, feel free to add sprinkles, chocolate shavings or your favourite candy on top!\r  \n\r  \n9. Cut into equal squares with a sharp knife \u2013 and serve!!\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThis is one of the best vegan chocolate cakes I've ever baked. It's rich, chocolatey and really moist! It's also great a few days after baking and surprisingly, remains moist! I gave a few squares of this cake to my friends and none of them could tell it was a vegan recipe.

Aside from that I have chickpeas (which are a pulse), sweet potato (which is a high nutrient root vegtable) and white sushi rice (which could be improved by using brown sushi rice, but honestly it doesn't matter that much to me). \n\nThese are some other nutritional benefits about my rice bowl (per bowl):\n\nProtein: 9.8g\nIron: 6.1\nPotassium: 248.5mg \nFiber: 3.9g\nB6: .04mg\nFolate: 15.5\u00b5g\nCalcium: 65.4mg\nVitamin A: 8.36IU \n\nWhile I am someone who is unaffected by your comment, you spreading dietary misinformation in the form of \"Would be all of my carbs for the day\" (indicating that 112 carbs is all a person should have, which is incorrect, and worded in a way that can feel shaming) could negatively effect someone who has an eating disorder/body image issues.

Preheat oven to 400\u00ba F\n2. Make the parmesan cheese - add the cashews, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, and salt to a **food processor** and pulse until it reaches a fine powder like texture. Keep 1/4 cup of the parmesan cheese aside for the recipe - store the rest in an air tight jar.\n3. Before you cut, you need to press your tofu - either use a **tofu press** or you can place your tofu brick in a thin kitchen towel and place a heavy object on top of it for 35-40 mins. \n4. Cut your tofu in your desired shape - I cut them in fillet shapes. I cut them horizontally in thirds and then with the tip of my knife, I cut out the 'fillet' shape. \n5. Add 1/4 cup of the parmesan cheese we just made into the bread crumbs and mix well to incorporate. \n6. Have a **baking sheet** lined with **parchment paper** ready \n7. In 3 bowls add corn flour in the first bowl, almond milk in the second bowl, and the parmesan bread crumbs in the third bowl\n8. Take one tofu fillet and coat it in the corn flour, tap off any excess and then dip into the almond milk, finally coat it in the parmesan bread crumbs mixture. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and repeat for the remainder of the tofu\n9. Bake at 400\u00ba F for 25 minutes, flipping the tofu over about halfway \n10. In the meantime, heat up your marinara sauce and cook your spaghetti noodles according to the package instructions. \n11. When the tofu is done, it's time to assemble. Start by adding your spaghetti noodles with some marinara sauce to a **platter**, then add the parmesan tofu and pour some more marinara sauce over the tofu - sprinkle with some parmesan cheese and enjoy!"], "urlNames": [{"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}], "urlLink": [["https://youtu.be/NtPzPu5uRdU](https://youtu.be/NtPzPu5uRdU)", "https://www.thesoulfulcook.com/post/veganparmesantofu](https://www.thesoulfulcook.com/post/veganparmesantofu)"]]}

Take two opposite corners of wrap, bring together and pinch. Keep holding in place while you grab another corner and bring it to the same point, do the same with last corner. You should see the Rangoon shape start to form. Smooth/pinch all connecting edges. If any edges aren\u2019t sticking just add a bit of water to them. \n6. In a medium sized pot, add liter of extra virgin olive oil and heat on medium high until olive oil is hot enough for frying.

You're arguing for the practice of exploitation. Why is it ok to take what is not yours? What do you have to do to get the honey from the bees?", "Feeding them simple syrup is a common practice, but a practice that's becoming more common (because it's more profitable) is exterminating the bees in winter and starting new colonies in spring.

I don't give a shit what anyone else eats, I just don't personally eat meat because the idea of eating an animal doesn't sit right with me. I recommend you very quickly backtrack this attitude you have of trying to convert others to your cause, because it sure as hell doesn't work and just gives all vegans a bad name.", "So if I participate in the exploitation suddenly I will see that it's ok! Not how it works. You should stop lying to yourself about what you do.\n\nDo you still eat corpses too?", "Bro literally my entire 1acre back yard is a garden, I'm a member of multiple CSAs and volunteer plenty.

Sounds like some niceguy shit.", "Nobody is \"infighting\" here, beekeepers and omnis in this thread are arguing for animal exploitation.", "You're not vegan if you argue in favor of exploiting animals. Honey bees are an invasive species in many ecosystems and outcompete native bees. Beekeeping IS harming the environment.", "Why can't you explain what you mean? What are vegan crops?", "I'm a former vegetarian who went vegan. Many vegans start off as vegetarian. I grew up in a family of hunters, but I started from the same idea that eating animals just didn't sit right. I was vegetarian for about five years, until I met vegans in real life and learned more about animal agriculture, not the sanitized \"happy animals\" propaganda that the industry puts out.\n\nYou are very much correct that my attitude was shitty here, and I apologize. I'm sorry for how I communicated, but I'm certainly not going to stop speaking. I'm very thankful that others talked to me and educated me so I can truly live my values.

But just like I said previously, bees are under threat in my country of origin (UK) and beekeeping is invaluable for boosting populations.", "My brother has been vegan for 10 years as I said previously, and we've had lengthy discussions about the subject. Ultimately, I have decided that being vegetarian was the right choice as I don't think I could give up many milk/egg products, as well as eggs being a key source of protein in my diet. \n\nAnd I don't buy any of the happy animals propaganda either, no veggies or vegans do.", "Stop trolling loser. You know what you're doing is exploitation and it's wrong. Look in the mirror.", "You argued that it benefits the bees, I asked how? Now you're backtracking?\n\nThis isn't about harm, YOU claimed it was beneficial for bees. Explain.", "Typical vegetarian logic. You just want to continue exploiting animals for your own selfish uses.", "Well we at least agree on the propaganda that the animal ag industry puts out. I won't comment on your diet, but I will point out that we're on a sub called r/VeganFood. We're just sharing vegan recipes over here for people who are interested, isn't it a little funny to come to a specifically vegan sub if you're not interested in veganism?", "Go outside and get some sun. It\u2019s a beautiful day", "Guess what happens to the majority of bees in the winter? They freeze to death. Honey doesn't help all of them but domesticated bees are given extra. And, beekeeping props up the bee populations in the UK which are falling drastically due to some disease.", "\"typical vegetarian logic\" yeah I'm done here, you're clearly insane or completely devoid of any form of logic at all. People like you are why vegans and vegetarians alike aren't taken seriously by mainstream society.

I hope you're bloody proud of yourself, because no one else is.", "And you virtue signalling while destroying soil, animals and insects. You truly are some of the worst people for the environment and you don\u2019t even realise.

Get off the internet and get outside.", "You're arguing FOR animal exploitation, which is the antithesis of veganism. Why is it ok to exploit animals? What does beekeeping accomplish that rewilding couldn't? Deluding yourself that exploitation is good for the environment is the whole problem.", "Sounds like projection dude", "That's great, and I'm glad it's getting exposure and people who may be interested are finding some new things! But honestly it's irritating when people come here with the intention to argue and call vegans \"stupid\" and insult us when we're minding our own business in a space that is clearly labeled. Have some basic self-awareness for the space you're participating in. Courtesy is a two-way street is all I'm saying.", "I am outside. Looking at beautiful almond and olive and oak trees. Listening to the birds sing and life thrive. And the bees. When you actually grow your own food, you realize there is a give and take to everything and it\u2019s impossible to walk the Earth and not starve without your definition of \u201cexploitation\u201d.", "I'm not arguing for animal exploitation, I'm pointing out how traditional beekeeping in a garden with wooden hives is not exploitation at all. You have been told by several actual beekeepers in this thread about why you're wrong but you just refuse to listen.", "I didn't have an intention to comment until I saw some questionable comments and figured I should try to correct them with what knowledge I had. Now, I don't necessarily agree with your honey pov but we can agree to disagree I guess", "So what's the difference between bees and animals? Why not eat corpses?", "You still eat corpses don't you", "I've also been told by farmers that gestation crates are great for pigs and battery cages protect chickens. Slaveholders also argued that slavery was beneficent too. Use your brain.", "I don't mean to criticize you at all, you've been very respectful in this thread especially compared to most others, and I truly appreciate that. That said, how confident are you regarding such \"questionable\" comments? How much effort have you put into verifying your stance, not simply repeating what beekeepers say?  We agreed that the \"happy cow\" propaganda is quite obviously propaganda, but when I provided a link to an animal ethics website you immediately called that propaganda? With all due respect, there's cognitive dissonance there, and I'm not pointing this out to be rude or critical but because you seem like an intelligent person with your heart in the right place. But I think understanding where the biased information truly lies is very important to evaluate factual information.", "The bees are not harmed by beekeepers taking honey off the top of the huge excess they produce. That honey would be wasted otherwise. Big difference between murder and exploitation that occurs on regular farms and helping out the bees by taking some of the excess of their backs.", "I do not", "What was that about making assumptions?", "So please explain what beekeepers do to the bees to get their honey?", "Beekeepers get the bees high to subdue their instinct to sting, before taking excess honey which benefits both. No bees are harmed at all.", "lol how do the bees benefit from being drugged? How is any of it beneficial for them?", "Bees get high, makes happy bees because they forget about all their bee drama and can just vibe.\nJokes aside, smoking the bees is proven to not do any long term damage and just subdues them temporarily.", "But how does it **benefit** them?

Does it have anything to do with humans taking over their habitat?", "[deleted]", "It's not about \"guilt\" or \"innocence,\" of course vegans still rely on agricultural like everyone else--no one is arguing that. It's about the degree of exploitation and resource consumption. Animal based foods consume FAR more resources than plants, because the animals need to eat. A single cow can eat up to 100lbs of grain per day: https://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat\n\n>The 7 billion livestock animals in the United States consume five times as much grain as is consumed directly by the entire American population.\n\n>Animal protein production requires more than eight times as much fossil-fuel energy than production of plant protein while yielding animal protein that is only 1.4 times more nutritious for humans than the comparable amount of plant protein, according to the Cornell ecologist's analysis.\n\nIn terms of energy efficiency and sustainability, a vegan diet is vastly more efficient than one that includes meat, never mind eating three meat-based meals per day as most Americans do. Vegans as a group are largely in favor of reducing fossil fuel use and and improving industrialized agriculture--and we acknowledge that livestock based agriculture is horrifically inefficient in terms of water, space, and GHG emissions.", "[deleted]", "You're sounding pretty hostile yourself right now.

Make a flax egg: add hot water to flax meal and let sit for 30 minutes.\n\nPreheat the oven to 180C/350F.\n\n2. Add the onion, garlic and mushrooms to a food processor and blend until no big chunks remain. Saut\u00e9 the blend in a bit of coconut oil for approximately 8 minutes until most of the water is evaporated.\n\n3. Now combine the saut\u00e9 and all the ingredients together. In a bowl mix the saut\u00e9ed mushroom, 2/3 of the flax eggs, crumbled tofu, oats, nutritional yeast, fresh or dried chives, black pepper, salt and if you like spicy, go ahead and add the chili flakes.\n\n4. Now make the Sausage Rolls.\n\nPlace some mix on a square puff pastry and fold it over. Seal it by pressing on the side with a fork.\n\nCut the long rolls into the sizes you want and space them out on a baking tray. \u00a0Brush the pastry with the rest of the flax egg and sprinkle some poppy seeds on top.\n\n5. Bake 20 minutes on 180C/350F in the middle of the oven and then 5 to 10 minutes on the floor of the oven, so it gets nice crispy and brown from below.\n\nDone \u2705\n\n\u2014\n\n[*\\*Like these recipes \ud83d\udc49 Get your FREE cookbook \ud83d\udcda\\**](https://thebgang.com/click-here/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=sausage_rolls)\n\n* [Instagram](https://instagram.com/thebgangcom/)\n* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCkYI-lOv3fOxTIpMYaioDg?sub_confirmation=1)\n* [Facebook](https://facebook.com/thebgangcom)\n* [Tiktok](https://tiktok.com/@thebgangcom)"], "urlNames": [{"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}], "urlLink": [["https://thebgang.com/click-here/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=sausage_rolls)", "https://thebgang.com/click-here/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=sausage_rolls)", "https://instagram.com/thebgangcom/)", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCkYI-lOv3fOxTIpMYaioDg?sub_confirmation=1)", "https://facebook.com/thebgangcom)", "https://tiktok.com/@thebgangcom)"]]}

Add 2 spoon fulls of Worcestershire sauce to this. And mix. (If you\u2019d like it extra spicy add 1 jalape\u00f1o) \n- Add 1 cup of store bought vegetable broth OR I like to Make a vegetable homemade tomato based broth using (3-4 tomatoes a handful of cilantro, 1 big yellow onion, green onions, 1-2 cloves of garlic, less than half of a shallot) (for a extra oomph) saut\u00e9 your vegetables until they cook down a bit then add the tomatoes last. \n- Continue to mix the pot with the beans and the pot with the broth frequently to prevent anything sticking to the bottom or burning. \n- Let that all boil and simmer down until the tomatoes start to get softer and basically disappear into the liquid. If they don\u2019t produce enough liquid while cooking you must add 1-2 cups of water or more of your vegetable broth.\n- Peel and dice 1-2 potatoes. Cut into medium-small cubes and add to the pot with the beans. \n- Add 3-4 bay leaves to the beans as well and let them continue to boil\n- Next season the pot with the Vegetables broth you\u2019ve created with either 1-2 packs of Sazon Goya Culantro y Achiote  & garlic power, salt, pepper, etc (your discretion) OR Use home made sazon \nCumin powder \nCoriander powder\nWhite pepper powder\nChilli powder\nPaprika powder\nGarlic powder\nOnion powder\nSalt \npepper \nDash of turmeric powder\nDash of oregano\n- Drain 3/4 of water that was boiling with the beans out the pot\n- Now add the vegetable broth to the pot with the beans & mix. \n- Add a few leaves of collard greens ( if you\u2019d like) \n- Add okra to your discretion (it helps with creating the thickness & it\u2019s honestly delicious! If you don\u2019t want to add okra you might want to add flour for thickness)\n- Next add ALOT of Cajun (and/or creole) seasoning & red pepper flakes\u2026 maybe cayenne too depending on how spicy you want it to be.\n- Taste and season to your discretion \n- Add hot sauce of your choice to your own discretion \n- Once the beans are soft you can begin to mash some of them into the liquid this is where you will get the thickness. I like to use a handheld pur\u00e9e blender because I\u2019m lazy or a high speed blender. If you use a blender take only 1-2 cups of the beans & vegetables broth out to blend then it add back to the pot. \nadd vegan sausage (I like to add field roast Italian sausage or smoked apple sage & simply truth plant based chorizo sausage)\n- Season well \ncayenne pepper \nCajun and/or creole seasoning \nWorcestershire \nLiquid smoke \nHot sauce \nAdd your sausages to your pot\nMix well \n\nAdd rice \nAdd parsley for garnish \n\nEnjoyyyyyyyyy :) \n\nWhen I made it I also ate it with a homemade vegan Mac & cheese & cornbread \ud83d\ude0b \n\nTip: I included the homemade sazon and broth option because it\u2019s both healthier and tastier in my opinion. Both of these add extra work/time but I believe it\u2019s both it! \n\n\nAlso this recipe is for a pretty big pot I fed about 7 or more of my friends and family with this yummy recipe.

Let me know how it goes for you if you make it!**\n\n**Recipe: Chocolate Twist Bread**\n\nIngredients\n\nFor the dough:\n\n* 500g All Purpose Flour\n\n* 100g sugar\n\n* 1\u00a0tbsp\u00a0active dry yeast\n\n* 1\u00a0tsp\u00a0salt\n\n* 100g melted coconut oil\n\n* 300ml lukewarm almond milk\n\n\nFor the filling:\n\n* 50g of dark chocolate chips\n\n* 25g of sugar \n\n* 15g\u00a0cacao powder\n\n* Pinch of salt\n\n* 150ml almond milk- heated to boiling\n\n* 28gr of melted coconut oil\n\n\nInstructions\n\n**MAKE THE DOUGH:**\n\n\u2022In the bowl of your standing mixer, whisk together flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. \n\n\u2022Using paddle attachment, stir in the melted coconut oil and warmed almond milk until well incorporated. Switch to dough hook.\n\n\u2022Using dough hook, knead for 8-10 minutes on medium speed. Half way through, if the dough appears too sticky, scrape down the sides and mix in another 2-4 tablespoons of flour to help it come together. At the end of kneading, the dough should be elastic, might be a little sticky, and will form a  ball.\n\n\u2022Shape dough into a ball and transfer to a lightly greased bowl. Cover loosely with a towel, and let dough rise someplace warm for at least an hour, or until doubled in size.\n\n\n**MAKE THE FILLING:**\n\n\u2022Mix chocolate, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt together in a small bowl.\n\n\u2022Pour melted coconut oil and hot almond milk over chocolate mixture. Let sit for 5 minutes. Stir until very smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use.\n\n\n**MAKE THE TWIST BREAD:**\n\n\u2022Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half. Cover and set half the dough aside. (You can repeat next steps with reserved half, or freeze it to use for later.)\n\n\u2022Gently knead dough for a minute just to release a little air. Roll into a rectangle. Spread filling evenly over dough, leaving on 1/2inch border around the sides. \n\n\u2022Roll up the dough tightly to form a log. Trim ends if necessary to keep it uniform. Gently cut the log in half lengthwise. \n\n\u2022With the cut sides facing up, lift one half over the other half to make a twist. Repeat until enire log has been twisted together. Gently press ends together.\n\n\u2022Transfer the bread into a greased loaf tin. You can also coil the twist into a spring form pan. Cover loosely with a towel and let rise an hour or until doubled in size. \n\n\u2022Halfway through second rise, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. \n\n\u2022After bread has doubled in size, brush top of loaf with a bit of almond milk (optional) and bake for 20-35 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the oven, and cool in baking pan for at least 10 minutes before removing.\n\n\u2022Cool completely before slicing."], "urlNames": [], "urlLink": [[], []]}

If you have time, place the oil in the fridge for around 1-2  hours (or overnight).\n* Then,  peel all the garlic cloves and remove the germ. If the garlic is young  and fresh there may not be much to remove. If it's older garlic and  there's a green stem inside, ensure you remove it.\n* Next,  add the garlic cloves and salt to a high-speed blender or food  processor and pulse until the garlic is relatively smooth. Scrape down  the sides and pulse a few times more as needed.\n* Now,  add \u00bd cup of neutral oil at a time very slowly to the blender on  low-medium power. Make sure there's a slow, but steady stream. Stop and  scrape down the sides with a spatula occassionally.\n* After the first \u00bd cup of oil is added, mix in 1 tbsp lemon juice, then add the next \u00bd cup of oil.\n* Continue this process until no ingredients are left and you have a creamy, thick, mayo-like consistency.\n\n### Notes\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Optional ingredients are not reflected in the price or calories of this recipe.\n* Nutritional information is a rough estimate.\n* Recipe calculations are based on ingredients local to us and may vary from recipe-to-recipe.\n* All prices are in USD.", "i love toum", "My Lebanese mother in law freezes the garlic cloves first, so it turns out more mellow and less burn-your-nosehairs-off.

In a skillet with a little vegan butter or olive oil, I saut\u00e9ed about a 1 1/2 cups diced onion, 4 cloves of garlic minced, a bunch of fresh chopped parsley, and the dry spices I wanted. I used cumin, coriander, celery salt, smoked paprika, chipotle, fennel seed, sage, salt and pepper. Once that was cooked down I added some vegetable broth and 8 Oz of chopped portabello mushrooms, simmered those down and added my cooked and chopped up broccoli, keep adding veg broth as needed to cook, once most of the liquid is cooked out transfer into large cooking bowl to cool. I added some left over gardein crumbles to this mixture bc I had them. Once the potatoes cooled I diced them into little square chunks and tossed them in with the filling mixture in the bowl. Taste after you add the potatoes, it will probably need more salt and spices, I added a little lemon juice to the mixture to add some zest. \nRoll out your puff pastry to fit your casserole dish. Keep pastry cold and don\u2019t over handle it. Once the filling is cool, you can put it in the refrigerator if need be, put a layer of pastry in your casserole dish, pour all filling on top of that, smooth it out evenly, put a layer of pastry on top of filling. Crimp edges down and SLICE THE PEICES BEFORE YOU BAKE IT, that way it doesn\u2019t crumble apart when you try to bake it. Put in oven 400f for about 20/30mins until it looks golden brown. I used the convection \nHope this helped\nYou can do it with phyllo dough too", "Damn that does sound like it's worth a shot haha."], "urlNames": [], "urlLink": [[], [], [], [], [], []]}

It's somewhat hard for me to write down the recipes, because I usually just wing the quantities and add/forgo ingredients depending on what I have/don't have in the pantry rather than follow a recipe to a T.  However here I try.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Idli**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used a ready mix. [This one](https://desibasket.com/gits-idli-mix?search=idli). You'd also need the right cooking vessel like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K5VH8SG?aaxitk=vt3u5eZTYyD94Zz1WtyN7Q&pd_rd_i=B00K5VH8SG&pf_rd_p=3fade48a-e699-4c96-bf08-bb772ac0e242&hsa_cr_id=2418257180201&sb-ci-n=asinImage&sb-ci-v=https%3A%2F%2Fimages-na.ssl-images-amazon.com%2Fimages%2FI%2F41S89Pr2YhL.jpg&sb-ci-a=B00K5VH8SG). Perhaps you can use ramekins (like those for creme brul\u00e9e). I have never tried them though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pulihora**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's [one recipe.](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/88ong2/tamarind_pulihora_with_coconut_and_carrot_vegan/) You don't need to add desiccated coconut and carrot or jaggery and asofetida. Another version is a lemon pulihora (instead of tamarind). If you are looking for tamarind, you can find it as a [concentrate](https://desibasket.com/ashoka-tamarind-concentrate?search=tamarind) or [peeled&pitted](https://desibasket.com/aeroplane-tamarind-slab-imli?search=tamarind).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sambar**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSambar is a basically a lentil vegetable soup to which you can add pretty much any veggies you have. Here's a [recipe I shared previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/9u2kc4/sambar_yellow_lentil_soup_on_rice_and_fried/).  I added this spice mix called [sambar powder](https://desibasket.com/priya-sambar-powder?search=sambar). You can leave it out if you are not keen on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Coconut peanut chutney**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was a hit at the dinner. My friends couldn't get enough of it. Since I am too lazy to write down my recipe here, I googled for one. [This](http://www.premascook.com/2018/04/peanut-chutney-groundnut-verkadalai.html) comes closest to how I made the chutney. I didn't use garlic at all. However I did add lightly-fried-in-oil green chillies to the mix (before grinding) instead of the red/dried chillies. Again if you don't have tamarind, use lime juice instead for the tangy flavor. I also didn't have curry leaves. You might be able to find them at an Indian store (nearby or online).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bread carrot halwa**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is my own making. You can find numerous recipes for bread halwa and carrot halwa separately, usually using ghee (clarified butter) and animal milk. I substituted the ghee with margarine and the animal milk with almond milk. I initially planned on making carrot halwa and later found some stale bread in the pantry, not enough for making bread halwa though. So I decided to add the bread to the carrot halwa to make it bread carrot halwa.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bread halwa](https://www.sharmispassions.com/bread-halwa-recipe/) recipe I followed. (Used almond milk instead of water, margarine instead of ghee).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Carrot halwa recipe](https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/gajar-halwa-recipe-gajar-ka-halwa/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBTW, I have no affiliation to the websites I linked. They just showed up on my google searches. I have had comments here before about how difficult it is to find ingredients for Indian dishes, so I am only trying to be a little helpful.\n\nAlso please do share if you end up making any of these items. Good luck!", "I definitely need more vegan friends. Come over. There's still a lot of leftovers.

Start by making the homemade ranch (you want it to be chilled before using it). If you are using my homemade vegan mayo then be sure to make that ahead of time as well. \n2.

Preheat the oven to 400\u00ba and line a banking sheet with nonstick parchment paper\n4. Be sure to press tofu to remove all the excess moisture. Cut the tofu lengthwise into 4 pieces and then cut in half - you should have 8 squares. \n5. Have your bowl of almond milk, bowl of bread crumbs, and bowl of corn flour ready to go - use a deep bowl to make it easier to dip the tofu. \n6. Add the paprika, garlic powder, and salt into the corn flour and combine\n7. Take a piece of tofu and dip it into the corn flour, then into the almond milk, and then into the bread crumbs - transfer to the baking sheet and repeat for the rest of the tofu. \n8. Bake at 400\u00ba for 20-25 minutes\n9. Remove from oven and in a deep baking dish add the HOT buffalo sauce. Submerge the baked tofu into the hot sauce and flip to make sure the tofu is completely covered with the buffalo sauce. \n10. Transfer back to the baking sheet and brush with some more buffalo sauce. \n11. Bake at 400\u00ba for another 20-25 minutes \n12. To assemble, toast the two ends of gf hamburger buns.

Solution: falafel tofu!", "body": "I found this old packet of falafel mix (the sort that you add water and oil to and fry straight off) in my pantry last night and decided I needed to use it and the block of extra firm tofu I had.

I took about 3/4 cup of the falafel mix and added garlic and onion powder, some dried herbs, salt, pepper, nooch, and ground jalape\u00f1o powder for a little spice. Then I tossed the tofu slices in the mix and stuck them in an air fryer for 15min at 375. \n\nLet me tell you, these are like a slightly grown up version of the only meat product I ate as a child, dinosaur nuggets. The coating gets super crispy, the tofu is crisp but moist and chewy- it\u2019s a really amazing texture. You get the falafel-y flavor from the mix and it\u2019s overall just delicious. I made a dip from some hummus and fresh lemon juice then tossed the cubes into a herbed tomato and kamut salad. Today I ate the leftovers as nuggets, just warmed up and dipped in leftover hummus sauce.
