If any of you know some cheeses that I haven\u2019t done yet I would love some input!\n\nHere is your daily cheese facts: Saint-Felicien is a soft, cow's milk cheese that originated from the farms in the Rhone-Alpes region of France. In France it is labelled a dauphinoise cheese, meaning it originates from the former French province of Dauphin\u00e9. The cheese is similar to Saint-Marcellin in flavour and texture, although it is almost twice in size and slightly rich and creamier. The French call this cheese Caille doux. Affinage for the cheese takes at least 2-6 weeks during which it develops a bloomy rind and a natural golden-beige colour. The taste, rind and texture are creamy, delicate and soft due to the use of soft curd in the cheesemaking process. In fact, the cheese is sometimes sold in a small ceramic or terra cotta pot since the pate can almost become runny. The optimal flavour of this very creamy, buttery and nutty cheese occurs between April and September. But it also consumed between March and December.\n\nAlso as a note, I gained control of r/dailycheese and now post my cheese there as well as in r/cheese", "You got about another 4 and a half years of this .

Kraft responded by changing the names of these products to \u201cpasteurized prepared cheese product.\u201d-[https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Milk%20Protein%20Products.pdf](https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Milk%20Protein%20Products.pdf)", "\u201c(d) The optional dairy ingredients referred to in paragraph (a) of this section are cream, milk, skim milk, buttermilk, cheese whey, any of the foregoing from which part of the water has been removed, anhydrous milkfat, dehydrated cream, albumin from cheese whey, and skim milk cheese for manufacturing.\u201d\n\nAbove is from 173.  \n\nUnfortunately the FDA decided to put their foot down on use of MPC since it\u2019s not technically a dried variant of skim or milk, but a combination of dairy proteins from various sources.\n\nhttps://idahomilkproducts.com/resource-center/what-is-milk-protein-concentrate-mpc/\n\nThe FDA believes that the compositional of a product should not change.  So removal of moisture is ok, but removal of say lactose through ultrafiltration is not ok.  \n\n\nI side with Kraft on this one.  You can get the same compositional using a variety of dairy powder.  Utilizing MPC should be legally allowed as it\u2019s still a dairy powder.  \n\nWhen you\u2019re talking a product that is 51% cheese anyways, does it matter if you\u2019re using MPC? Or using a blend of WPC, NFDM, dairy powder is a dairy powder and can be blended to achieve a composition needed to fit your product? I would have to do research to be 100% sure, but I\u2019m pretty sure it has to do with costing and legalities of using different class pricing of milk and powders and the utilization of import dairy costed differently then how the USDA sees fit.  \n\nSo Kraft decided to skirt legislation, because formulating not utilizing MPC would cost millions of dollars.  \n\nCould Kraft now further go and reduce cheese content since they changed their name enough according to the FDA?  Sure but with process singles you still need a certain percentage of curd to keep things together.  Deviating you\u2019re too of a level will result in a product that won\u2019t hold firm.  It\u2019s possible they have some wizardry that is the best kept secret.  But they are still most likely using their formula that was based off the original standard of identity, but at some point they found MPC as a source of cheap solids for that other 49% while maintaining the functionality they need.  Either that or they are using starches like day a cheese dip, but they would get in huge trouble for not declaring it on ingredient list.  So that\u2019s extremely unlikely. \n\nChanging the name ever so slightly was enough to appease the FDA and get them off their backs.  \n\nIn my opinion this is all moot.  As I don\u2019t prefer singles.  I prefer the real American process cheese.\n\nIt conforms to part [169](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=133.169)", "Thank you, see my response to the other."], "urlNames": [{"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1002)>"}, {"error": "<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1002)>"}], "urlLink": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], ["https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/07/whats-really-in-american-cheese.html"], ["https://youtu.be/MvbdUkcYo5o)"], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], ["https://i.redd.it/fw7g1wypx8p31.png"], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMR8a8nCM4c)"], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], ["https://www.seriouseats.com/whats-really-in-american-cheese"], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], ["https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velveeta#cite_note-chicagobusinessnews-8)"], [], [], ["https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=133.173"], [], [], [], [], [], [], ["https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processed_cheese"], [], ["https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=133.173"], [], [], [], [], [], [], ["https://www.themilkweed.com/Feature\\_11\\_Sep.pdf](https://www.themilkweed.com/Feature_11_Sep.pdf)"], ["https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Milk%20Protein%20Products.pdf](https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Milk%20Protein%20Products.pdf)"], ["https://idahomilkproducts.com/resource-center/what-is-milk-protein-concentrate-mpc/", "https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=133.169)"], []]}

If any of you know some cheeses that I haven\u2019t done yet I would love some input!\n\nHere is your daily cheese facts: Maroilles is French, AOC approved cow\u2019s milk cheese made in the Picardy and Nord-Pas-de-Calais regions of Northern France. Also known as Marolles, the cheese gets its name from the village of Maroilles where it is still produced. It is also said that the cheese has been created in the 10th century by a monk, Maroilles in northern France. While preparing Maroilles, the industrialized version uses pasteurised milk as opposed to the artisan cheese which is still depends on raw milk. It usually has a square shape with brick-red, smooth, washed and sticky rind. When young, the cheese is called \u201cMaroille Blanc\u201d because the cheese has still not developed the distinctive brick red rind and characteristic flavour.It is matured from five weeks to four months during which it is regularly washed with salt and water. If eaten young, the cheese is still chalky in the center and has a bitter rind. As it ages and with the washing process, the rind changes its colour from yellow to orange and finally red. At four months, the ivory p\u00e2te is soft and oily. It has a powerful, pungent aroma suggestive of fermenting fruit and the flavour reminds of smoky bacon. Earthy notes of walnuts and mushrooms contrasted by a strong, pungent aroma are very typical of an aged Maroilles. This cheese is produced in various sizes and the content of fat is about 29 per cent.\n\nAlso as a note, I gained control of r/dailycheese and now post my cheese there as well as in r/cheese", "Ch'est euh'l Chnord cha !

Credit to Cheese.com for the cheese image.\n\nHere\u2019s your daily cheese facts: Labneh (also pronounced as labaneh, lebnah or labne) is a cheese made from salted strained yoghurt by draining its whey. It is also known as strained yoghurt, yoghurt cheese or Greek yoghurt. Traditionally in Arabian countries, the whey is strained in paper bag or filter, made of muslin. While Labneh is classified as a cheese, it retains the distinctive sour flavour of yoghurt. It forms a traditional and important ingredient of Middle Eastern and south Asian cuisine. The procedure of making Labneh is same as strained yoghurt, that of boiling off some of the water content, adding salt, butterfat and powdered milk. Eaten both cooked and raw, it is used in savoury sauces as it does not curdle at high temperatures, unlike normal yoghurt, due to its high fat content. It is used as dip for bread, added to stew, and to add creaminess to soups. Also used as a sandwich spread. The cheese has to be consumed within a week of its preparation. Nowadays this cheese is also available in low fat variety.\n\nAlso as a note, I gained control of r/dailycheese and will be posting my cheese there as well as in r/cheese.", "Lemon a d olive oil... you can add either garlic or Zaatar (wild thyme and sesame) for an exquisite taste", "Cheese", "mmmmmmmmmm......", "How many cheese pics do you have my god", "Please enjoy it with some mint.

The main difference here is the type of lactic acid bacteria (yogurt is a \"thermophilic\", heat loving, bacteria as opposed to the more buttery \"mesophilic\", medium temperature loving, bacteria that is often used in lactic set cheeses).  The other difference is that labneh is a fresh cheese -- it usually isn't aged. But there is no reason at all that you can't age it (as long as you drain it for a long time).  There are other yogurt cheeses in the middle east that are aged.  They are usually covered in spices.", "Add some mint! Trust me, it's heaven!", "These are labneh balls.

The mass has a yellow colour with a golden-brown crust and a hole in the middle. Used widely in Eastern European and Georgian cuisines, Sulugni's melting quality makes it a perfect accompaniment to almost any dish. It is eaten simply as a table cheese or added to salads, antipasto, marinades with oil and herbs or any other dish that requires a melting cheese. In fact, it is the perfect pizza cheese!\n\nAlso as a note, I gained control of r/dailycheese and now post my cheese there as well as in r/cheese\n\nEdit: Sorry, I just realized this image has a watermark.

Overcooking the cheese (bringing the curd to a higher temp than you would use for soft cheeses) makes the proteins bind more tightly, so the cheese gets a more plasticky texture (they're usually not very pleasant if you don't warm them) and makes it so that they soften and brown instead of melting when you heat them.\n\nNot necessarily *simple* but definitely easier than trying to fly to Finland in November during a pandemic.", "Or Minnesota or Wisconsin or the UP in Michigan.

Thought that might be too big so have been using farfalle and also penne, so obviously not traditional for either of these dishes(being not always correct ingredient). But damn are they both good!!\ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd2f", "I like to put some pasta on my cheese .", "I know this is a meme post, but I always think there is always an opportunity to learn about cheese -- especially with pasta.  Dry grated cheese on pasta is a bit of a shame in my opinion.  I say that with some sadness because I spent 50 years of my life eating that way out of ignorance.  There is a dramatically better way to eat it and it is at least as easy: cacio e pepe.  Best description of how to do it that I've seen: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6QWoOQMvE8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6QWoOQMvE8)  Though I have a soft spot for Alex the French Guy whose series on it opened my eyes to this amazing dish.\n\nLong story short: If you boil your pasta in a small amount of water and stir it around a lot, the water will pick up a lot of starch.  If you melt cheese in starchy water, it will emulsify -- that means it makes a sauce.  This works for almost all cheeses (even those that don't usually melt like parmesan).  The sauce will coat the pasta and will be dramatically more flavourful than any grated cheese you add on later that you could imagine.  Also cheese and pepper is the most incredible taste combination on earth.  Literally the only ingredients you need are salted water, spaghetti, cheese (any kind, but Pecorino Romano is traditional) and pepper.\n\nOnce you try that, it's a small step to other kinds of sauces.  Traditional carbonara has no cream.  Just exactly the same as cacio e pepe with the addition of cured pork and an egg yolk.  The egg yolk also emulsifies to make the most decadent sauce you could ever imagine -- it puts a cream based sauce to shame.  But you can also simply do a cacio e pepe and then mix in some meat sauce (like a Bolognese).  It is really the next level and \\*so\\* much better than grating cheese on top that it isn't even funny.\n\nSo, I know this was a meme post, but as a cheese fanatic you seriously need to try this.

Sold exclusively in 30-ounce cans since 1948, this semi-soft cheese is made from pasteurized cow's milk. When out of the can, visually, it's a white cheddar with rounded edges and without a rind. The texture is smooth and firm, but it becomes crumbly and crystalline with age. The flavors are creamy, nutty, and sharp, with a milky smooth and mellow finish. The cheese is stored for at least one year before it can be sold. Cougar Gold was originally produced with a bacteria called WSU19, which limits carbon dioxide production so that the cheese can be safely stored into a can. Nowadays, the cheese comes in the following flavors: Original, Natural Cheddar, Smoky Cheddar, Viking, Dill Garlic, Sweet Basil, Hot Pepper, and Crimson Fire.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "Novel.

If any of you know some cheeses that I haven\u2019t done yet I would love some input!\n\nHere is your daily cheese facts: Abbaye de Belval is a traditional French cheese that's also known as Belval or Le Trappiste de Belval. The cheese is produced in the region of Picardy by Trappist sisters and it's made from raw cow's milk. Belval matures for 60 days in the abbey cellars. This semi-soft cheese and has a golden and glossy washed rind. Underneath it, the body is ivory white in color and elastic. The aromas are subtle and light. Apart from the basic Le Belval Nature that's washed in a simple brine, there are also Le Belval Bi\u00e8re Blonde, washed in blonde ale, and Le Belval Bi\u00e8re Brune, washed in brown ale. It's recommended to pair the cheeses with light and fruity reds or full-bodied red wines.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "u/verysuspiciousduck You should post a picture of Kraft cheese cubes one day for shits & giggles. :)", "I haven\u2019t followed closely but I see these every once in a while and I thought they would run out soon somewhere around 400, I am shocked how much cheese there is.", "Reddit just asked me if we discuss a lot of sex and violence in the cheese reddit.", "I've tried a very similar cheese called Alp Blossom except it was from the Swiss Alps.

Unfortunately, it was not as tasty as it looked. \n\nDried rose petals and calendula or marigold and cornflower are actually quite bitter, and add an undesirable texture like bits of tissue paper.\n\nThe cheese itself was mild, slightly sweet with a hint of acidity and muskiness, but was unfortunately overpowered by the bitterness of the floral and herbal elements.\n\nIn the end, paying $20 for it was a waste as we didn't finish the round and it spoiled some time later.\n\nA sweet and/or salty element is desperately needed in cheeses like this. The flowers themselves taste like hay when you take away the bitterness and florality.\n\nA bit of honey, fennel pollen, and a sprinkle of fleur de sel would elevate the experience of eating a cheese like this.\n\nNote: I have had two cheeses like this. The one I was referring to was a goat cheese which had more pronounced bitterness and muskiness. I have also had Blumenk\u00e4se which has some similar notes, but is sweeter, and less bitter and not musky. The latter is more palatable by itself and would go well with a drink, on crackers, or as part of a charcuterie.

The outside thin shell is a pasta filata curd made of buffalo and/or cow's milk mozzarella while the insides contain a soft, doughy, stringy, mixture of curd and fresh cream. The cheese originated in the Apulia region of Italy known for sheep farming and agriculture. It is sold traditionally in asphodel leaves with a polyethene plastic bag over it. The green colour of asphodel leaves is an indicator of the freshness of the cheese.\n\nEdit: Thanks to u/ten-tail-whale for suggesting this cheese", "Just recently I realized that Burrata is actually my favourite cheese of I had to choose just one. A few weeks ago I bought four Burratas (?) and all of these were slightly different in consistency, haptic and flavour.

Chimay is better known for the beers they also make and export far and wide. I excitedly clicked this post hoping to find some cheese-beer hybrid made by master brewers. Not the case this time, but still hope I get to try their Cheese one day. The words used to describe how they make it aren't very appetising what with churning curds, stiff pastes and brine baths but I'd like to hunt this cheese down someday. I wonder if they do a beer washed version?", "I\u2019m back to using stock images for now because I couldn\u2019t find any more images I took and forgot to post so I\u2019m going to have to wait till I finish my current cheeses. After I finish all of my cheeses, I will go to the store and get new types. I hope you understand. Credit to blogspot for the cheese image.\n\nHere\u2019s your cheese facts: A cheese produced in Chimay, Belgium under the historic guidance of the monks who originally produced cheeses within the Trappist monastery and community. The cheese is made from cow's milk and is considered to be a semi-soft pressed cheese. Pressed cheeses are manufactured by churning the curds until they are very small in size at which point they are reheated to harden the curd in order to create a stiffer paste. The suspended whey is then extracted into a mould where it is formed into a small round wheel of cheese that is then removed from the mould and brine cured for only a few hours. Following the brine bath the Chimay cheese is salted and stored in cool moist cellars to age for several month", "The trappist monks know their whey around.", "My new best and most suspicious follow, thank you mr. duck.", "How would you describe the flavor of this cheese? And btw, I'm really enjoying these posts!", "I really thought you were playing a joke on me by sticking a cheese sticker on a squash", "Update me when their is a Duvel cheese.

Like everyday? Please! Cheese!", "I actually did not know they made a cheese.", "They do make a beer-washed version, and to date it's the worst European cheese I've ever had. It's semisoft, and I recall it being aggressively bitter with a cocktail of chemical flavors, including ammonia and chlorine. I honestly don't remember the positives of the flavor experience because the negatives were so overwhelming.\n\nI'm a significant beer enthusiast, so this was a letdown that stuck with me. It's possible that I hit a bad or poorly stored batch, though.\n\nEdit: This blog post captures my experiences with the cheese pretty well as I remember them: https://cheesechatter.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/chimay-a-bitter-rejection/", "The same monks also make some interesting beers.", "Thanks for following!", "I love you both", "Their cheeses are very good", "Same", "I didn\u2019t either before yesterday, it seems good though", "Well that's quite the accolade!

The cheese is made from pasteurized cow's milk and is best described as a cross between Cheshire and Stilton. Shropshire Blue ages from 10 to 12 weeks and develops a natural rind that hides a creamy and smooth texture of the carrot-colored body with blue veining throughout. The orange color comes from annatto. The aromas are strong and rich, while the flavors are intense, sharp, tangy, creamy, and full. It's recommended to pair it with a glass of Pinot Noir or Riesling.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "This is one of my all time favourite cheeses.

The cheese has got a thin, brownish-orange coloured rind and a pale yellow pate with a few and scattered open holes.

This cheese acquires its typical ochre-yellow color and aroma through the smoking process, for which only birch from the local woods is used. It is sometimes immersed in olive oil to inhibit the growth of mold. For an interesting twist, the young and smoky San Sim\u00f3n da Costa is best enjoyed with homebaked bread and sweet caramelized apple marmalade.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "Blurssed buttplug", "Omg this cheese is from where Im from!

Can we not just enjoy something without souring it by involving Trump in every thought and comment? He\u2019s not gonna stop being an asshole no matter what is said about him. Do we seriously need to ruin *cheese* by relating it to Trump? Every time the word \u201cpresident\u201d comes up, relevant to America or not, someone makes a low-effort Trump joke like it\u2019s going to change the state of the country and finally make everyone realize that he shouldn\u2019t be president. \n\nI can\u2019t be the only one who\u2019s just genuinely sick of him. Not just \u201csick but still talking about him at every possible opportunity and making/sharing every social media posts and buying bumper stickers so everyone knows how sick of him you are.\u201d It\u2019s almost over and we just have to elect someone else. If he\u2019s the only candidate that gets *consistently* discussed, negatively or positively, and he\u2019s the name that is most present in all voter\u2019s minds, he\u2019s bound to get re-elected. The fact that he got elected in the first place was *so* heavily influenced by how many people hated him. The fact that *so many* people hate him, but hate him in the way that makes then rage debate over him, made the people who liked him all the more passionate about getting him in the White House. It shouldn\u2019t have been a contest with him, but he made us on the left *so mad* that the rural American community, who felt like Trump was their ideal candidate because although wealthy, he spoke to the things they were worried about, got excited about politics for once. \n\nThe outrage around Trump is what got him elected in the first place. The underrepresented rural populations of America, assisted by the electoral college, and fueled by the virulent outrage from the left. Not Russians or vote fraud or bullshit. Democrat disorientation and panic put Trump in the White House. I think the sooner we come to terms with that and stop trying to say everything is rigged against us, and instead put up a genuine, well-rounded, honest Democratic candidate that we can *all* get behind, the sooner we can legitimately say bye bye to the Trump administration. As long as we\u2019re joking about him and bringing him up in every context if we think we\u2019ll get a laugh and a few upvotes, nothing will change. If we\u2019re just ripping on him everywhere and every chance we get and not promoting our own candidates nearly enough then we will have NO candidate to get behind.

I think it would be more effective than we consider to stop including or alluding to him in casual conversation. \n\nThe fact that there are people who not only like him, but like him more for how much other people *don\u2019t* like him, it\u2019s directly contributing to phenomena like the familiarity principle/mere-exposure effect, and environmental spoiling, and because of this really unique situation, those sociological effects directly feed each other. Right and left liking or hating trump, making each other like or hate trump more in response, and that just trickles down into society until the like and hate are almost impossible to separate and all that\u2019s left is \u201cTrump\u201d. That\u2019s my reasoning for feeling the way I do. It\u2019s not just \u201cew Trump stop talking about him\u201d like stop making him part of everything, stop putting him at the forefront of everyone\u2019s minds as if he\u2019s not already there.

I do agree that some of the best Canadian cheese comes from Quebec, and you\u2019re right that there isn\u2019t much interprovincial cheese export; this is because most dairy processors (cheesemakers) have a provincial dairy processing licence, which means they can only sell their products within their province, as opposed to a federal licence which allows you to sell across the country. Because Quebec and Ontario have the population and highest cheese consumption in the country, most cheesemakers in those areas don\u2019t need to bother with getting a federal licence because the market is big enough in those areas of Canada. \nThe dairy industry in Canada is complicated and confusing but we have some of the highest quality milk in the world, some of the highest food safety standards in the world, and it shows in our cheese!!", "Huh, so they can't sell (some of) it in other provinces?

(i personally know a creamery this happened to, which a huge loss to their viability as a business) in the UK, due to the rampant beaver bovine tuberculosis situation, some producers are forced to pasteurize their cheese even though they would prefer to produce with raw milk. and directly to your point about purchasing from multiple farms, true artisan producers may purchase from a couple small farms. in that case, i still empathize with the decision to pasteurize and it definitely doesn't make them a commodity.", "yeah let\u2019s take the pasteurizing piece out. there are too many exceptions to that rule.", "So in that case... what about Comte?

Provolone Valpadana is nowadays produced all across Northern Italy; it is made with whole cow's milk and available in two varieties, Dolce (sweet) and Piccante (piquant), both of which can be Affumicato (smoked). Aged for 2-3 months, Provolone Dolce has a delicate flavor and goes well with young, fruity wines, while Provolone Piccante is matured for at least 4 months and paired with aged, red wines, since it has a much sharper, tangy flavor. Both varieties are extremely versatile and often enjoyed breaded and fried, grilled, or served with Mostarda di Cremona, a Northern Italian condiment made of different fruits preserved in a mustard seed flavored syrup.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "But why does it look like garlic?", "Lol I thought it was a butt plug.", "They look like if they grow on trees and that you have to peel them first.", "holy shit you\u2019re still going.

If any of you know some cheeses that I haven\u2019t done yet I would love some input!\n\nHere is your daily cheese facts: Red Leicester, formerly known as Leicester or Leicestershire cheese is a traditional hard English cheese made from unpasteurised cow\u2019s milk. The history of the cheese dates back to the 17th century when farmers recognized the need to make and look their cheeses apart from cheese made in other parts of the country. They decided that the colour of the cheese should denote its richness and creaminess. To set it apart from cheddar and highlight the quality of cheese, Leicester is coloured with a vegetable dye called annatto. The rind is reddish-orange with a powdery mould on it. The colour indicates that the milk used has a high cream content. Today, only a a couple of farms in Leicestershire makes the cheese using traditional methods and raw milk. Red Leicester is a hard cheese, similar to Cheddar but much more moist, crumblier with a milder flavour. It matures faster than cheddar and can be sold as young as two months. A good Leicester cheese can be identified by a firm body and a close, flaky texture. Though the cheese can be consumed young, to reach it's optimum flavour, it should be allowed to mature for six to nine months. A good cheese tastes slightly sweet with an almost caramel flavour and builds up a more robust taste as it ages. The cheese suits a full-bodied white wine such as Muscadet, SancerreChenin Blanc and Vouvray.\n\nAlso as a note, I gained control of r/dailycheese and now post my cheese there as well as in r/cheese", "A most excellent cheese", "Love your work mate, I'm feeling more adventurous in the cheese aisle nowdays!", "To be forever remembered as the bane of Chris Morocco.", "This makes such a nice grilled cheese sammich!", "I'm impressed you went 212 days without mentioning this absolute classic.", "I'm a born and bred Leicesterfarian and I approve of this", "My favourite on a jacket potato!

The smoked rind is very hard and even cracks when cut, the light ebony interior is also hard but much smoother and easy to cut. It really is a bundle of very long stringy braided and tied together and then smoked, so the braiding isn't just a show. The strings are merged in the inside due to pressure but fall apart very easily.  \nOkay, so the package said lights smoked but if that's true I can't fathom what intensely smoked cheese would taste like. This stuff has an incredibly heady, tangy flavor. The end at the bottom of the braid was really salty and overall just almost overwhelmingly smoky.  \nOther than that I couldn't discern any other flavors at all.  \nExcept for the misleading label, it was an tremendous cheese.

Credit to Landings and Takeoffs for the cheese image.\n\nHere\u2019s your cheese facts: Roquefort cheese originates from a small village called Roquefort-sur-Soulzon located south of France in the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es region. Roquefort is made predominately from the milk of Lacaune sheep although Manech and Basco-B\u00e9arnaise breeds are also used. Roquefort cheese is prepared by treating sheep's milk with a special type of bluish-green mold called Penicillium roqueforti, traditionally extracted from loaves of bread that were left to mold in the caves within the Combalou mountains. The process of aging Roquefort cheese is referred to as interior ripening where additional bacteria and mold are introduced during the aging process. A specially harvested bacteria Penicillium roqueforti is injected into the curd, which grows in small fissures in the cheese creating the characteristic blue-green veins and imparting a sharp tangy flavor.\n\nThanks to  u/BrittnayBailey for suggesting this cheese", "A toast with butter and roquefort....

The semi-soft cheese is made from raw cow's milk and ages for 7 weeks. It's rolled in bread crumbs to give it a rough and sandy rind after which it's named \u2013 the name of the cheese means Sandy from Wissant. The rind absorbs the local beer in which it is washed during the maturation period. The texture is supple, rich, creamy, and dotted with tiny eyes. The aromas and flavors are yeasty and slightly sweet (because of the beer), with a pungent and barnyardy finish. Due to its distinctive visual appearance, Sabl\u00e9 de Wissant is often used on cheeseboards. It's recomended to serve it with a glass of Champagne or a light ale.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "Please never run out of cheese.

Credit to Jamonessinfronteras for the cheese image.\n\nHere\u2019s your daily cheese facts: Idiazabal (also known as Idiazabel / Queso Idiazabal La Vasco Navarra) is a traditional, farmhouse, hard cheese made from raw milk of Latxa or Carranza sheep in the Basque and Navarra regions of northern Spain. Named after the village of Idiazabal, the cheese received Spanish D.O. (Denominacion de Origen) in 1987. In summer, the sheep migrate to higher pastures to graze on the blossoming, new grass. During this time, the artisanal cheese makers milk the sheep, make the cheese and leave it in the rafters to mature for a minimum ripening of 2 months. At the end of summer when the cheese makers return back to the lowlands with their sheep, the cheese has ripened and is ready for sale.\n\nAlso as a note, I recently gained control of r/dailycheese and will be posting my cheese there as well as in r/cheese.", "I am from that region.

The problem though, is the best way to subsidize agricultural goods is to stockpile them. Obviously you can't do that very well with Milk. The solution that was settled on was buying 10s of thousands of pounds of American made cheddar. The government did this for more than a decade, storing big blocks of perfectly curated cheddar that is all the right color and consistency in giant warehouses, in military installations, in mines and caves. But the problem came in that after doing this for so long, they had waaaaay too much cheese, it was too costly to store, costing millions a year and finally with a new president at the helm the decision was made to cut the program. You can't just sell all that cheese back though, you would very likely crash the dairy industry the government sought to bolster in the first place. So what they did was blend hundreds of blocks of cheese together at a time while adding stabilizing agents to make it a uniform consistency again. Then, they sent it to food pantries and added it to food stamps and similar programs to support the poor and needy.

It became a Canadian delicacy in 1996 after the Dubois family recreated it at their \u00c9co-D\u00e9lices dairy in Plessisville, Quebec.  The original Mamirolle is still made in France but it is narrower and thicker with a dark red rind. The exterior of Mamirolle is moist and bright orange in colour but lends out a strong, earthy pungency. A wedge of this cheese reveals a rich, supple, uncooked and semi-hard elastic pate. The flavours are sweet, fresh and mild with an edge of saltiness and sweetness. A tasting of Mamirolle leaves behind an almost buttery texture in the mouth. It is very similar to Limburger and the period of maturation takes at least 3 to 4 weeks on wooden planks. During  maturation period the cheese is washed in brine with annatto. Mamirolle has won the Selection Caseus award in 1999 presented by the Dairy School of St. Hyacinthe.\n\nAlso as a note, I post my cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "I can't believe you're still going", "It a twinkie.", "Are you going to cover non conventional cheeses?

It is made with whole cow's milk and produced in the provinces of Ravenna, Forl\u00ec-Cesena, Rimini, Bologna and partly Ferrara, all located in the Emilia-Romagna region. Since it doesn't take more than four days to mature, this cheese should only be consumed fresh, within a few days of production. Squacquerone di Romagna is creamy and has a particularly delicate, slightly sour flavor. Squacquerone is perfect as a spread, especially on Piadina Romagnola, a type of flatbread traditionally prepared in the Romagna region.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "I have been waiting for over two years for you to share this!!!

So in the way whey is cheese, yes, it's cheese. Frankly, if even the dairy lobby can't get it called cheese, it ain't cheese in my book.

That makes perfect sense to use for dips and toppings, but I form my cheese opinions mostly based on how they work alone (which is why I say I don't like Swiss cheese [Emmentaler]). I value depth of flavor far more than smoothness in my cheese, making mexican blend preferable, as it is essentially American cheese before it was homogenized.\n\nAlso, American cheese can be made non-cheddar cheeses, including hard/washed-curd cheeses.

You're from another country, you don't understand how it is here any more than I understand what it's like in New Zealand.

It's a cultural problem here that is hard to fight against since the corporations have such a stranglehold on the political parties here. I genuinely believe more Americans would love to visit other countries, but it's hard to warrant the cost to travel to another country when you only have 10 days total of PTO. Anybody working part-time jobs or working any \"low-skill\" job doesn't get any PTO at all.\n\nNot saying any of this as a pity party, I just don't think you've really thought about why Americans don't travel and are relying on stereotypes instead of any logical thought.

Probably more rude than an insult but it just seemed uncalled for in the moment.

American nationalism is a thing but holy fuck you're pretending like New Zealanders don't care at all that they're from New Zealand. Is your rugby team not a huge deal? Why would you guys even care what the All-Blacks do? Maybe you dont in particular, but many New Zealanders support the All-Blacks for that reason. You're acting like Americans are the only ones who behave this way. Fuck, if you went to Europe, I'm sure you'd see a lot of this \"nationalism\" from then once you start spitting \"facts\" about their people as if they are some homogenous entity?\n\nExtreme American nationalism is not that much of a thing here.

Most of us realize we have some serious problems and that there are many countries that do shit better than us. \n\n To get back to the topic, none of us were saying that American cheese is the best thing ever.

You are furious at people commenting on the USA, and criticising it, when you have never lived elsewhere. Fascinating .", "Lmao I don't care if people criticize it. I'm annoyed at being stereotyped for being American about something that is out of our control. Americans don't just not travel because we don't want to do it, it's just hard for most here to take the time to do it since vacation time is horrible over here because we have people that don't want others to \"be lazy\".

Our government is set up in a way that let's the minority  have a larger voice than the majority.

That rhetoric is popular with conservatives here,  maybe you aren't so different?", "Not conservative at all, little chap. If you choose to stay in the USA, good for you.

My point was that your attitude towards people's financial struggles shows similarities to American conservatives.\n\nI'll stay in the USA since my industry is compensated very well here and there are limitless jobs for me to take in it here. It's good in other countries, as well, but most don't really compare to how easy it is here to get a well-compensated position here.\n\nI plan to travel, mostly centered around going to different race events all over the world.

Sadly I most likely won't be able to catch an AFL game while I'm there like I really want to do. My friend that I plan to stay with would probably rather drag me to a rugby match since that's bigger in NSW and he grew up there anyway. Can't watch AFL here right now either unless I pay for a subscription which I really don't feel like doing lmao.

Credit to \u201cTaste Atlas\u201d for the cheese image and cheese facts. If any of you know some cheeses that I haven\u2019t done yet I would love some input!\n\nHere is your daily cheese facts: J\u0101\u0146u siers is a fresh cheese made from milk and curds, to which butter or cream, eggs, salt and caraway seeds are added. The reason why J\u0101\u0146u siers is so unique lies in the traditional production methods and correct proportions of ingredients used giving this cheese its distinctive color and flavors, all of which have remained unchanged for hundreds of years. When translated into English, Janu siers means John's cheese because it is always made at summer solstice for the festival of Jani, on the eve of St. John's. Even the round shape of J\u0101\u0146u siers has a special meaning \u2013 it symbolises the sun and the world and when eaten, it is believed that a person takes part of the sun's energy. Traditional preparation methods require that the cheese is wrapped in a way that the knot is in the centre of the cheese, and the folds of the fabric are arranged in such a manner that imprints are created on the surface. This way, the famous 'J\u0101\u0146u siera viduc\u012btis' ('the middle of the J\u0101\u0146u siers') is made and the folds leave traces that look like J\u0101\u0146u siera viduc\u012btis ('the middle of the J\u0101\u0146u siers') is made and the folds leave traces that look like sun rays. The cheese is moderately salty and has a clean, lactic-acid flavor and the aroma of caraway seeds.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "How in the world are you still going?

A variation of this cheese exists also in Corsica (France), where it is called casgiu merzu, and is especially produced in some Southern Corsican villages like Sartene.

He said he was riding up the mountain to try to get elevation to see if he could get high enough to find his friends below. All of a sudden he broke through the snow and fell into a crevasse. Next thing he knew, he was back on his sled driving back down the mountain, but he was completely soaking wet. \n\nHe didn't say anything to his friends, but instead asked them if they saw anything. One of them said they saw him riding up the mountain, then he just disappeared, and a few minutes later he was coming down the trail. Went from above the treeline to them in mere seconds, but him and his sled were like they just went into a lake. Soaking wet. They got him to a fire to warm up, but once they shut his sled off it wouldn't start again. He swears he remembers bouncing off the walls on the way down the crevasse, then just transported to the trail. This was just over 20 years ago and he hasn't been back since until now.

Just a heads up...this recipe is restaurant style. It\u2019s the only way I know how to make it so please excuse the weird measurements and cook times. \n\nI use a plastic 2oz cup and 32oz (quart container) cup for most of my measurements. \n\nThe most important ingredient is pre-cooked corn meal. I use the PAN brand because it\u2019s the standard in Puerto Rican cooking. You can use this amazing product to make lots of different fried corn treats. It\u2019s also vegan and gluten free! \n\n~8-10 jalape\u00f1os (mix green and red for more colors) Small dice with seeds. \n\n~2 ears corn shaved. Use a grater on the cob to get that awesome corn milk. \n\n~1 bunch chopped scallion (greens only)\n\n~2 quarts water\n\n~2oz kosher salt\n\n~4oz white sugar\n\n~2oz honey\n\n~1oz granulated garlic\n\n~1oz granulated onion\n\n~2oz extra virgin olive oil or butter\n\n\nGet that all in a good size sauce pot. You\u2019ll need the extra room in there when the corn meal gets added. Bring to a soft boil. Take your time hearing it up. Let it  get there slowly so it has time to really get the flavors steeped in the water. \n\nTake that off heat and move to a counter and have your 2lb bag of PAN open and ready to pour. DO NOT USE A WHISK!! DO NOT ISE A WHISK!! Use a large, strong spoon. Serving spoon or a wooden spoon will do. DO NOT USE A WHISK. Slowly add the corn meal into your pot stirring nonstop. It\u2019ll get real think and pasty. But don\u2019t stop! Truck through it! You\u2019ll notice some dry spots where it all powder. Just press it in it will continue incorporating as you go. Scoop that stuff into a bowl. It\u2019s gonna be hot! But be careful and keep mixing as much as you can. Let that cool for about 10-15 mins before you start forming anything. Now, we cut the cheese!\n\nI use mild sharp yellow cheddar for meltiness and color. Cut roughly 60 /1/2 inch cubes. If you need more, cut more. If you made too much, enjoy your snack cheese or give it to a dog. \n\nNow you\u2019re ready to form. Put on latex/vinyl gloves. Use a 1oz scooper (the kind with the release trigger) to scoop a heaping portion. Flatten in your hand like a pancake. Place cheese cube in there and fold over. Roll in your hands a bit so there are no open spaces and no cheese too close to the edge. Do that a bunch more times. Have some warm water handy because as you get close to the end, the dough can dry up a little. Pat a little on your pancake to wake it up. You\u2019ll figure it out. Place them in a wax lined container with wax paper between your stacks. Store in the fridge for a few days or freeze them for later. \n\nI cook mine in corn oil at 325 until a kinda dark gold/light brown. Be sure to season with salt as soon you pull them out of the oil. Let them sit a few mins.  Do not bite into them. Break them open so you don\u2019t burn your mouth.  For dipping I like honey or sour cream with lime zest. \n\nThis would kill at thanksgiving or a large football party. \n\nOr you can come to my restaurant @ilikefoodnyc and have me make it for ya!! \n\nGOOD LUCK!!", "This needs to be tagged NSFW", "sploosh", "Thanks for making my mouth water haha", "FOO-OOK", "Recipe please!", "Op we need the recipe.

Records suggest the cheese was made by the monks of Glarus since the 8th century. But its recipe was formally protected on 24th April 1463 at the Glarner Landsgemeinde, when it was decided that in order for the cheese to be called Schabziger, it had to be marked with a stamp. This makes it one of the oldest protected cheeses in the world. The cheese is produced from skimmed cow\u2019s milk with addition of blue fenugreek, a type of clover which gives the cheese a pale lime colour. It is an extremely expensive herb brought to Europe in ancient times from the Middle East. At the last stages of production, Schabziger is molded into distinctive conical shapes and then wrapped in silver foil, ready to be sold. Texturally, the cheese is dry, hard and aged while flavour wise it is pungent, spicy and delicious. If a milder taste is required, the cheese is mixed with butter to make a spread called Zigerbutter. The cheese is used in cooking as a condiment or as a dipping similar to the Dukkah. It is also grated over food or the butter-mix paste is spread over bread or crackers. The cheese is high in protein and almost fat-free.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "One of my all time favourite cheeses!", "Thought it was a solidified chunk of yogurt for a sec.", "Congrats, you have broken 400 days", "Popular in NEW Glarus, Wisconsin.

There will almost certainly be at least one kind on the menu if you have a local Georgian restaurant (common some places, impossible to find in others). The Georgian cheese varieties like sulguni might be very hard to find, but a mix of mozzarella and feta work well as a substitute.

This small, mold-ripened cheese has a thin dry rind with a stony aroma. The flavors are rich, full, balanced, salty, buttery, and reminiscent of popcorn and mushrooms. As it ages, Constant Bliss becomes rich and soft, although not quite runny.

If any of you know some cheeses that I haven\u2019t done yet I would love some input!\n\nHere is your daily cheese facts: The Pallone di Gravina is made from cow\u2019s milk, and is firm in texture. The cheese comes from the regions of Basilicata and Apulia in southeast Italy and dates back to the days when the livestock was migrated from place to place. The term \u2018Pallone\u2019 comes from the word \u2018palla\u2019, the round ball-like shape of the cheese, which makes it easier to hang them in caves or transport over the backs of the donkeys during the livestock migration or the transhumance. The cheese is made in the style of pasta filata, and generally weights between 1.5 and 2.5 kg. It is shaped like a balloon, and was traditionally created in the city of Gravina, in the province of Bari. However, in the recent times the cheese is produced only in the regions of the province of Matera. The rind of the cheese is straw-coloured, smooth and hard. It becomes browner as it ages, and turns golden when the cheese gets fully matured. It needs to be aged for at least twelve months before it reaches maturity. The process of making this cheese starts with warming and curdling with rennet and then they are placed in a tompagno, which is a perforated basket. After some hours the sets are sliced up and \u2018spun\u2019 in hot water. The portions of cheese are then moulded manually, and after salting in brine for 12 to 20 hours, they are allowed to dry. In 2009 the comune of Gravina made an application for the cheese to receive PDO status within the European Union. \n\nAlso as a note, I post my cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "Why does this pic make the cheese look massive?!

Of course, both are raw milk cheeses and so both are not available in the US.  Because Brie is so famous, cheese makers around the world borrow the word for their similar cheeses.  However, how similar are they?  Most of them are actually \\*quite\\* dissimilar.\n\nI appreciate that there will be people who feel very strongly that having only 2 styles of Brie cheese is silly.  But consider how you would feel if you had been buying \"Wisconsin Cheese Curds\" only to discover that it is actually European gouda.  You'd think, \"Hey, wait a minute.  It's \\*not\\* from Wisconsin and it's \\*not\\* made in the same way as cheese curds.  WTF?  How are they allowed to call it Wisoconsin Cheese Curds\".  Brie that is not from the Brie region and not made in the style of Brie de Meaux or Brie de Melon is incredibly misleading, IMHO.  It robs us consumers of realising that there is a real Brie cheese made differently and which has a different texture and different flavour than the stuff marketed around the world as \"Brie\".\n\nI mean, you might think, \"Oh well, they should have protected their name earlier\".  But they don't even let Coulommiers call their cheese \"Brie\".  And it's made in Brie!  And it's made in essentially the same style as Brie!  They are \\*really\\* picky!\n\nWith all the AOC/AOP cheeses with dubious claims to generic names out there, this one is just so clear cut to me that I think it's worth mentioning if we're going to post a picture and say \"This is Brie\".  And even though reddit is often dominated by Americans who have little hope of trying actual Brie cheese, I think it's worth having a thought that there is something worth going out of your way and trying if you manage to make it to France (or another country that isn't so milk phobic).", "Too cheesy take my upvote!", "Nope", "Its been a while since I bought great cheese.\n\nBest wishes to you.

Really dude? Raw milk is 1,000X more likely to make people sick. Is it a huge risk? No, but it isn't irrational to pasteurize milk. As a lover of cheese I find it easy to see both sides of the argument.", "Thanks for the advice! I will update this post and provide a link once I\u2019m able to buy some Brie and take an image of it myself.", "Have you tried Cambozola Black? It's basically a blue/brie hybrid.", "In UK I can buy Brie de Meaux from good cheese shops and in general I can buy lots of cheeses made from raw milk.", "You can buy Brie (from Brie) in other countries because they don't ban raw milk cheeses.  But other countries can't make true Brie because Brie is a region of France :-)  I can't actually think of any producers outside of Brie that try to make something in exactly the same style as Brie either.\n\nBrie de Meaux is a raw milk cheese that's around 15 inches across (~36 cm) and weighs over 6 lbs (just under 3 kg) for a single wheel.  Despite being so large, it is only about 2 inches (5 cm) thick.  This unique shape changes the way the cheese matures.  Additionally, by regulation Brie de Meaux is a raw milk cheese.  This means that the local bacteria in the milk influences the taste.  Unlike many artisan cheeses called \"Brie\" in the US, the regulations on Brie de Meaux specify a lower bound of 45 percent fat by dry weight.  While this is higher than the cheese you might make with a supermarket milk, it's *much* less than the double cream \"Brie\" cheeses you might see in the US (which are at least 60% fat).  Such a cheese would be called a \"double cr\u00e8me\" and are *not* Brie cheeses.  Brie de Meaux also traditionally uses a particular strain of penicillium candidum (the white mold on the outside of the cheese).  I've used it before in my home cheese making.  It is a tricky strain as it tends to be quite patchy and difficult to  age -- but of course it has a very different flavour (it breaks down the fats differently).\n\nBrie de Melun is a smaller cheese. It is only 11 inches (27 cm) accross and weight just over 3 lbs (1.5 kg).  Brie de Melun is quite special in that in addition to the white penicillium mold, it has a red bacteria called brevibacterium linens growing in it.  This is the same bacteria that you would find on washed rind cheeses.  This makes Brie de Melun much stronger flavoured with a fair amount of funk to it.  Like Brie de Meaux, it is a raw milk cheese and the fat content starts from 45% by dry weight.\n\nMost producers of cheeses with penicillium candidum mold tend to make then similar to either Camembert or they will make a double or triple cr\u00e8me.  These tend to be quite tall for their width and make a *very* different cheese.  Traditionally, for white bloomy rind cheeses outside of Brie and Camembert regions of France, you tend to find cheese with a yeast called geotrichum candidum.  These are quite delicious, but again very, very different than Brie.\n\nSo, after that long answer: no, I'm really not aware of any cheeses outside of Brie that attempt to make anything that is particularly close to Brie.  It's not really an economical cheese to make in the traditional style.  It's very expensive and very fiddly.  Having said that, there probably *are* some tiny artisan producers somewhere trying to give it a go, but I bet they don't call their cheese \"Brie\" -- because they understand the value in protecting small traditional producers of unique cheese.", "You can\u2019t import it. You have to go to France. Not sure If Canada allows sake of raw milk cheeses.", "Excellent!!!", "Yum!\n\nNot yet, but will have to go looking for some.\n\nThanks!!!", "I mean because of EU regulations on food and names should it be only the real Brie.", "Only type of brie I could find by Google in my country is from Pr\u00e9sident what's whit that?", "Ah, ok.

If any of you know some cheeses that I haven\u2019t done yet I would love some input!\n\nHere is your daily cheese facts: This is one of the five kinds of Greek cheeses that can be made entirely from goat's milk, however, it is usually made from sheep milk or a blend of sheep and goat milk. This soft, grainy cheese has been produced for many years exclusively in Grevena Prefecture and the Voio area in Kozani Prefecture. In the past, it was produced in western Macedonia by local shepherds, who would rennet their milk in the morning and leave the curd to rise during the day. Its name is even derived from this method \u2013 anevato means 'the cheese that rises'. Today, the procedure begins with storing the milk at 18 to 22\u00b0C . When it obtains the needed acidity, it is moved to cooling chambers for 24 hours, and rennet and salt are later added. This cheese takes two months to mature. The flavour of Anevato cheese is described as acidic, fresh, and quite rich. Since it has such a creamy texture and no crust, it is usually eaten with a spoon. With a refreshing, pleasant, slightly salty taste, this unique cheese can be served alongside any meal or enjoyed with a glass of wine. \n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "You\u2019re nearing 1000 cheeses!!!

I hope you understand. Credit to Costco for the cheese image and cheese.com for the cheese facts. If any of you know some cheeses that I haven\u2019t done yet I would love some input!\n\nHere is your daily cheese facts: Tete de Moine cheese is being made for eight centuries. It is believed that the monks staying at Moutier the mountainous zone of the Bernese Jura in Canton of Bern manufactured this cheese. And hence the cheese takes the name 'Tete de Moine' meaning 'Monk's Head'. The cheese is made from cow's milk and half-cooked or half-hard pressed paste. The cheese develops its scented flavours effectively only when it is scrapped. So, to enjoy the best taste, a tool called 'Girolle' was invented in 1982. A scraper attached to the central axis of the apparatus makes scrapping the cheese easier!Tete de Moine proves to be the best companion of Crisp White Wines such as Pinot Grigio.\n\nAlso as a note, I gained control of r/dailycheese and now post my cheese there as well as in r/cheese", "Another one of my favourites. \n\nStory time. First time I had this was a a wine and cheese show and then I had to have a griolle to make the cheese flowers. A little while later I was at my favourite cheese shop in Toronto (Cheese Boutique) and I found one. As I\u2019m at the till with my wife next to me the total suddenly jumped up by like $80 when they scanned the Griolle and my wife looked at me and said \u201chow much is that thing?\u201d I just looked at her and said \u201cshhhhhh it\u2019ll pay for itself.\u201d  We\u2019ve gotten a lot of use out of it and now have 2 in 2 different countries. \n\nSecond one had me fighting a deli manager at an upscale grocery store in Shanghai who refused to sell me the Griolle when I found Tete de Moine in China. I had to argue with him that I couldn\u2019t buy the cheese (the whole wheel) unless he sold me the machine. He said no it was only for display and to eat the cheese normally ie slice it up. \n\nLove Tete de Moine cheese flowers with a touch of honey, maple syrup or nice jam. Great on their own as well.

Tete de Moines became one of our favorites, and, of course, we (I...) felt that acquiring a Girolle was a must, because there\u2019s nothing like a freshly shaved rosette. \n\nMy opinion on the unique, delicious, delicate, and balanced experience offered by the Girolle is this: Tete de Moines\u2019 thin rind (washed?) is deeply flavorful and funky in a Limburger sort of way, but paired with a mild semi-hard center. When shaved, the ratio of center-to-rind is very high. The resulting aroma release of the rind is further diluted by the large amount of exposed surface area of the center, ultimately bringing just enough funk to make the cheese interesting, blending that funk with a heavy dose creamy/nutty/floral from the center.\n\nA beautiful cheese. The only one that I know of that absolutely requires the right specialized tool to present it.", "Thanks!", "The one thing to note though is most Chinese chefs only have 1 knife.

The cheese is made from pasteurized Pezzata Rossa cow's milk, which is more acidic than other types of milk. The other name of the cheese, Toma Brusca means acid cheese, referring to the process of leaving the milk to acidify before cheesemaking. As a result, after 30 to 90 days of aging, the flavors are bright, tangy, tart, and slightly spicy. Due to the fact that the cheese ripens from the outside inwards, the texture is softer as it gets closer to the (inedible) rind. The aromas are earthy and reminiscent of hay. It's recommended to pair Castelrosso with Barbaresco and serve it with chestnut honey or mostarda.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "Not super easy to find (in the US) but it's available right now from Murray's in NY: [https://www.murrayscheese.com/castelrosso](https://www.murrayscheese.com/castelrosso)", "Do you have a list of cheeses you've already done ? \n\nif so, have you done Emmentaler yes?", "I hope you are eating plenty of fiber.", "I'm just one guy but after two years I've genuinely had enough of these posts.

The Dutch word kanter, meaning 'edge', gives the cheese its name, because there is a sharp corner at the bottom of the cheese, and it is rounded off at the top. The rinds of these cheeses differ from one another, so Kanterkaas and Kanternagelkaas have a transparent or yellow rind, while Kanterkomijnekaas may be either transparent, yellow, or red. It's made in two fat categories, 20+ and 40+, with minimum 20-25 and 40-44 percent fat content, respectively. The flavor of the cheeses changes a lot with aging. Kanterkaas tastes spicy to tangy, Kanterkomijnekaas tastes spicy, fragrant, mild to strong, and Kanternagelkaas varies in flavor from spicy, warm and spicy to tangy. As it ages, its texture becomes more suitable for grating, and the cloves and cumin are spread evenly throughout the cheese. Its orange color comes from added annatto (a natural dye), providing a great contrast to the dark cloves. Since it has a hot, spicy and aromatic taste, it should be used sparingly, and goes great with salads, hot dishes, and beer.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "Also good on buttered kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6d (Swedish crisp bread).  \nNagelkaas and komijnekaas are very popular.

Since it is made from whole milk, it is has a high fat content, approximately 26%. There is also a lean version available with only 17% fat. The texture of the cheese resembles Monterey Jack or a firmer version of the Mozzarella. Hush\u00e5llsost, a staple on every Swedish farmer\u2019s table, is said to have originated in the 19th century and is closely related to Port Salut. Hush\u00e5llsost is produced in a drum shape weighing one to two kilograms each. The cheese cylinder is wrapped in a plastic cling before letting it mature for around 60 days. Traditional, Swedish Hush\u00e5llsost is mild, creamy and brings out flavours of clear salt and fresh acidity. It has a pale, straw-coloured interior with a smooth, open texture and small irregular holes. The low-fat version has a slightly buttery and nutty taste.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "V\u00e4sterbottenost is the best Swedish cheese and in my opinion one of the finest in the world", "I've been following this off and on since around the beginning.

Upon ripening, it develops an off-white colour and a natural ash casing to protect it from too much moisture in the air. The cheese tastes smooth with undertones of bitterness. It has a slightly grainy texture and a sweet aftertaste. Once cut, it lasts for 3 weeks in the refrigerator.

The aroma is earthy and the flavors are buttery, seriously rich, nutty, salty, and citrusy. Boursault ages for 12 days, and it spends an additional month in its packaging.

For producing 'Bermuda Triangle', the cheesemakers use pasteurised goat's milk. It is coated with a layer of edible black ash, sprayed with mould cultures and ripened / cold stabilized for several days before being sold in the market. When young, the interior of the cheese is chalky white in colour with a smooth, firm and slightly crumbly texture. As it ages, the paste below the velvety white bloom rind starts becoming softer, lucid, and ultimately runny. The cheese displays tart and tangy with intense pepper notes, which become assertive as it ages. Bermuda Triangle goes well with candied fruit, spicy nuts, and pears. This cheese has won many awards including First Place, American Cheese Society, 1998, 1999, 2002, 2013, 2014. sofi Awards, Perishable Food Service Product, 2013.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "\"It's not a phase dad!

Underneath the natural rind, the texture is smooth and firm, with bits of truffles dispersed throughout the paste. The aromas are intense, exotic, and spicy, while the flavors are savory, creamy, and salty.

It is mildly salted and usually served at breakfast with honey, jam or filled in pastries. Fresh Anari should be consumed soon as it is very perishable. \n\nAlso as a note, I gained control of r/dailycheese and now post my cheese there as well as in r/cheese", "the picture looks great and your description of it is just... omg \ud83d\ude0d", "Definitely would have for breakfast.

The cheese comes from the regions of Basilicata and Apulia in southeast Italy and dates back to the days when the livestock was migrated from place to place. The term \u2018Pallone\u2019 comes from the word \u2018palla\u2019, the round ball-like shape of the cheese, which makes it easier to hang them in caves or transport over the backs of the donkeys during the livestock migration or the transhumance. The cheese is made in the style of pasta filata, and generally weights between 1.5 and 2.5 kg. It is shaped like a balloon, and was traditionally created in the city of Gravina, in the province of Bari. However, in the recent times the cheese is produced only in the regions of the province of Matera. The rind of the cheese is straw-coloured, smooth and hard. It becomes browner as it ages, and turns golden when the cheese gets fully matured. It needs to be aged for at least twelve months before it reaches maturity. The process of making this cheese starts with warming and curdling with rennet and then they are placed in a tompagno, which is a perforated basket. After some hours the sets are sliced up and \u2018spun\u2019 in hot water. The portions of cheese are then moulded manually, and after salting in brine for 12 to 20 hours, they are allowed to dry. In 2009 the comune of Gravina made an application for the cheese to receive PDO status within the European Union. \n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "I still appreciate all of these posts every day, thank you! \n\nI am however keeping my fingers crossed for a particularly specific type of cheese tomorrow, given the number it will be!", "Where\u2019s the yolk?", "Cheese egg", "That reminds me me of a larger-that-grapefruit sized Edam that we used to buy around Christmas at Sam\u2019s Club.

The texture is fudgy and supple while the paste is rich and beefy with hints of grass and nuts. Grayson goes well with bread or dried fruits. As it melts beautifully, it could be used with a variety of dishes. The cheese pairs well with a full-bodied white, medium red, beer.\n\nAlso as a note, I post my cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "We used to carry Grayson at my restaurant for our cheese selections for building charcuterie boards.

Hopefully somebody else here can provide a better response!\n\nGrayson is less pungent than the cheeses that are specifically marketed as such, but on its extreme end, is significantly more pungent than pretty much any other \"non-stinky\" cheese I've had.

In consistency terms, it isn't nearly as soft as something like epoisses, nor even a bleu - its consistency is a bit like butter.

La Luna starts life in the same way as Holy Goat\u2019s other lactic acid fermentation cheeses. After the milk is drawn from the goats, it is pasteurised at 63 degrees C for 30 minutes, then it is chilled to 26 degrees C and the starter cultures are added. Curds begin to form slowly over a period of about 20 hours at 20 degrees. They then hand ladle, very carefully, into moulds. The molds are left to drain all day, turned the next night and then the curd is turned out of the mold the following morning, and salted. They reduce the temperature to 14 degrees C. The young cheeses are turned daily until the rind is well formed and the cheese matured. They found that the cheese grows its rind within 24 to 48 hours after ladling the curd into molds. They expect that most people will eat their La Luna in one sitting. There\u2019s no better way than serving up a small circle of la luna, cut it into segments like a cake and eating as-is, or just with bread. Cheese is a complete food. The simpler the better. Ensure that you smell the cheese before you taste it (will enhance the taste hit) and warm it slightly in your mouth to let the flavours infiltrate. Take the time to eat and savour it, from the rind to the paste.\n\nAlso as a note, I post my cheese on my r/dailycheese subreddit as well as here in r/cheese.", "The GOAT of Australian goat cheeses in my opinion.", "Looks like an oreo with extra filling", "This is one of the most interesting cheese shapes I've ever seen.", "This one is dope", "I want so bad to cut it in half for some reason", "forbidden double stuf oreo", "U close to running out of cheeses yet?\n\nEdit: looked it up and holy shit, your not even close", "cheese", "Holy goat of la Luna Batman!", "That cheese has more wrinkles than my brain"], "urlNames": [], "urlLink": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]}

The aromas are rich and the flavors are citrusy, zesty, lemony, tangy, and slightly sweet, while the rind gives off savory and nutty notes. This cheese is named after the local Neolithic settlement.

Zasavica donkey reserve, a donkey farm inside Zasavica, about 80 kilometres from Belgrade produces the donkey cheese by hand-milking a herd of about 100 endangered Balkan donkeys. By selling the donkey cheese at 1,000 pounds per kilogram (app. $576 a pound, sometimes much, much more), the Zasavica donkey reserve plans to sponsor their conservation work. It takes 25 litres of donkey milk to produce just one kilogram of white & crumbly smoked cheese.

Add milk (about five cups) slowly, whisking constantly until the sauce is thick and bubbly. Remove from heat and stir in your cheeses of choice- you want about a pound and can mix it up depending on the flavor profile you\u2019re going for but I almost always do half sharp cheddar and generally something like gruyere or Monterey Jack- you want to go for both flavor and melting quality. Add a pinch of nutmeg to up the cheesy flavor, more salt/pepper as needed, and mix with a pound of al dente noodles.

OP thanks for sharing\n\n\n\"I\u2019ve noticed some cheeses are coated in ash. What is the ash, and why do producers do this?\n\n\nThe ash you see is a food-grade (sterile) charcoal ground to powder. Charcoal? Yuck, right? Au contraire. It serves a number of purposes and has a long-standing tradition of use\u2014particularly in a number of beloved cheeses from France.\n\nMorbier\u00a0cheese, for example, was originally developed with a thin line of ash running horizontally through its middle because it served as a kind of bug repellent during cheesemaking. Back in the 19th century, Morbier was made in two phases over the course of 24 hours (not in one process as is done today). The curds for the cheese were created twice daily, following each milking. To protect the evening curds in their half-filled molds from insects, the cheesemaker dusted the exposed surface with ash. The next morning, another layer of curds from the morning milk was added atop, hence the dividing line of ash. Even though the ash is no longer needed to make Morbier, its striking dark midline makes it immediately identifiable, so the sprinkle of ash between two layers continues.\n\nIn myriad little goat cheeses, an ash coating actually grants the surface of the cheese a more hospitable environment for the desired mold growth and rind formation.\u00a0\"", "Shropshire for the win!!!

I hope you understand. Credit to Wikipedia for the cheese image and cheese.com for the cheese facts. If any of you know some cheeses that I haven\u2019t done yet I would love some input!\n\nHere is your daily cheese facts: Valen\u00e7ay cheese is one of the classic French cheeses made in the province of Berry in central France. It is named after the town of Valen\u00e7ay in the Indre department, France. This cheese comes in two types: the one coated with wood ash and produced on farms is called Valen\u00e7ay Fermier while the other coated with vegetable ash and made in dairies or industries is called Valen\u00e7ay Laitier. Valen\u00e7ay is an unpasteurised goats-milk cheese. Its rind has a rustic blue-grey colour which is made of the natural moulds. The rind is then darkened by dusting charcoal powder. It is available usually between March and December, with peak manufacture between April and August. Valen\u00e7ay cheese used to have a shape of a perfect pyramid with a pointed top. But when Napoleon returned to the castle of Valencay after his unsuccessful expedition in Egypt, he saw the cheese, in a fit of rage drew his sword and cut off the top of the cheese. Since then the cheese has always been made with a flattened top.\n\nAlso as a note, I gained control of r/dailycheese and now post my cheese there as well as in r/cheese.", "Don't ever run out", "I live 30 minutes away from the village Valencay so seeing this makes me happy. Valencay has always been on the table during family gathering and i love it.", "One of my parent's favourite, a classic, really good goat cheese!", "I\u2019ve heard of this cheese and recognized it from the flat pyramid shape! On my list to try for sure.", "One of my faves", "This is my friend's favorite. I was too chicken to try it for a while, since I was hesitant about ash in cheese.", "This post made me so happy! Valencay was the cheese my bf and I bought at a French cheese shop our first time in Paris- we took it and a loaf of bread back to our hotel to have for dinner, ordered a side salad from room service and laughed that upon arrival \u201ca side salad\u201d was just a bowl of lettuce.

There is a wine called Valen\u00e7ay and a cheese called Valen\u00e7ay and its protected because you have to respect certain condition to be able to name your product Valen\u00e7ay.", "It's absolutely cheese, IMHO.  It's a lactic coagulated cheese made from goat's milk.  It doesn't use rennet, but many cheeses don't use rennet (including Brie de Melun, if my understanding is correct).  The ash on the cheese reduces the acidity of the surface of the cheese and allows a yeast called geotrichum candidum to grow on top of it.\n\nIt's possible English is not your first language.  It would be strange to say that it's an ash-ripened goat (a goat is an animal with 4 legs :-) ).  In French, it's a style of cheese called \"chevre\", which means \"goat\" in French -- but just means that it is made with goats milk.  Many, many, many famous cheeses are made with goats milk (either in whole or in part).\n\nYour customers are not confused if they call Valencey a type of cheese.  I'm a bit curious why you think it's \\*not\\* a cheese.", "you are right it is cheese.\n\nyou imo just gave the cheese type 'lactic coagulated cheese made from goat's milk'\n\nValencey is a type of this cheese. it does not define this cheese type. to me. perhap i am wrong. and welcome the discussion.", "Oh.

If any of you know some cheeses that I haven\u2019t done yet I would love some input!\n\nHere is your daily cheese facts: Purple Haze is an American cheese produced in California by Cypress Grove. It dates back to the 1970s, when Mary Keehn found herself with excess goat milk and invented the cheese in the process. Nowadays, the milk is pasteurized in vats with coagulants and cultures, and the mix is then placed into a curd press to drain. The curd is combined with salt and shaped into disks which are dusted with wild fennel pollen and lavender. Without aging, the cheeses are sent to markets where they can be sold and consumed.\nThis aromatic, fresh, soft cheese has no rind, and its texture is crumbly, smooth, creamy, and spreadable. The flavors are earthy and herbaceous. It's recommended to pair Purple Haze with Riseling or Sauvignon Blanc. Try it with bacon-wrapped dates or finocchiona salami.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "all in my brain!", "Cypress Grove is hands down my fav cheese producer 10/10", "Is that a jojo reference?", "So\u2026 Jojos anyone?", "I always hear Dion singing Purple Haze!", "Such a great cheese!

At the end of the day, it's a factory job.\n\nTo give you an idea of what goes into a normal day, physically:\n\n* After the curd is made, it is pressed and drained in bags. After draining, you work in two man teams to remove and empty bags into wheeled carts. Each bag is 100 pounds, give or take. There are 50 bags per rack, 100 bags per curd press, two curd presses.\n\nDue to the nature of the system, you take each bag off the rack using one arm. Locking your elbow at 90\u00b0 you lift up and manipulate it over to the table under which the carts sit and then lift the bag and empty it. \n\n200 times.\n\nThen you toss all bags into the wash, then remove sopping wet bags from said wash and put in carts to dry.\n\n* When we mix the curd with flavors and aging cultures (depending on the cheese we're making, we use a mix of house curd and out of house curd. The house curd is stored in the aforementioned wheeled carts, which contain ~300 pounds of curd whereas the out of house curd is shipped to us in 20-50 pound bags depending on the manufacturer.\n\nThe wheeled carts can be directly loaded into the lifter to dump into the mixer, which streaks maybe 15 feet tall. The out of house needs to be taken out of the bags and emptied into a wheeled cart in order to make it into the mixer. This involves lifting, bending, and maneuvering ~80 20# bags per mix.\n\nDepending on the day, we will do anywhere between 5-10 mixes per day, each being multiple tonnes in weight.\n\nBut, that Purple Haze does smell great!", "I feel funny, but i don't know why!", "Excuse me while I kiss this guy!"], "urlNames": [{"error": "<urlopen error timed out>"}], "urlLink": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], ["https://www.ordercheesepeoplemi.com)"], [], [], [], [], []]}

Originally from the Meuse region, Carr\u00e9 de l'Est is both the heir of locally produced cheeses and of cheeses produced by the first industrial cheese dairies of the region, i.e., Bries (still widely produced in Meuse). It is with the development of the dairy industry that its farm production will be absorbed, for the benefit of a cheese gaining in notoriety but with a standardized taste. Fortunately, it managed to survive within small productions, which have allowed it to return to the shelves of cheesemongers eager to let us know its taste. It has the particularity of being produced with a washed rind (which is more often found) or a bloomy rind, reminding us of its Briardic origins. Its ideal consumption period is from April/May to August, when it best reveals its smoothness and creamy taste. Be careful though, it can reveal a rather pronounced taste when it is well matured!  \nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)", "Very yummy looking", "CHEESE = LIFE", "Yassss", "Looks good and yummy", "When are we gonna see you eat some cheese in the wild?", "Hopefully soon!

Unlike the traditional \"Swiss\" cheese, Challerhocker has a smooth paste, without any holes or cracks. The initial aroma and flavor is of roasted peanuts and caramel (yum!), with sweet notes and a lingering salty finish. Dense and silky, it is easily cut with a table knife and is perfect for sandwiches and paninis, or for a cheese board. \n\nAlso as a note, I gained control of r/dailycheese and now post my cheese there as well as in r/cheese", "I really like this one.

It is produced in Epirus and Thessaly in central Greece, and is made from sheep or goat milk, or a mixture of the two, although traditional Galotyri is made using only sheep milk and a bit of salt. Nowadays, it is mostly produced in August from the thick, fatty summer milk of sheep and goats reared traditionally in the region. Galotyri is a soft, rindless, creamy cheese with a pleasant and fresh taste. Its aroma is slightly sour, and it pairs especially well with ouzo and raki. It is not as popular as other cheeses produced in Greece, and it is sometimes used as a replacement for feta in recipes.

The taste is intense and sharp, typical for fried cheese. Additionally, caraway seeds may be added to the cheese, and that is the only other variety that can be produced under the protected name 'Wielkopolska fried cheese'. It is made according to a local, traditional recipe typical for the Wielkopolska region since the 18th century when it was probably first made by the settlers who arrived in the western part of the region.

The company follows a special procedure to produce their cheese, which involves maturing it in caves for a minimum of 6 months. In addition, they make sure the cheese making process starts in mid-April when the grasses feed the cows better and the milk supply is sufficient. Havilah is a dense cheese with a beautiful, earthy black rind made from a layer of ash beneath which lies a dense, yellowish pate. Slightly pungent, this mouth-watering dense cheese reveals fruity tones of pineapple, citrus, and caramel. It is perfect for grating or meting on dishes such as pastas or crisps. If Havilah is aged beyond 16 months, it begins to develop granules giving the cheese a wonderful texture.\n\nAlso as a note, I gained control of r/dailycheese and now post my cheese there as well as in r/cheese.\n\nEdit: It appears that this image is not of this cheese, sorry for the inaccuracy, my source of information was wrong.", "I'll give you another 1685 days before you run out", "The image is not Havilah.", "\"cupcake cheese\"\n\nI'd try it!", "I swear, your posts are so aesthetically pleasing.

After heating, rennet is added to the milk to curdle it, and when it separates, it is strained and packaged in parchment immediately. Serra da Estrela cottage cheese ranges in texture from creamy to grainy. It is white and takes the shape of the vessel in which it is placed, and it has a mild and pleasant flavor and aroma. The history of Serra da Estrela cheese is well documented. In the past, the cheese was packaged in the oldest form of packaging \u2013 it was wrapped in cabbage leaves and transported in wicker baskets. It remained a local product for a long time due to the fact that it would spoil easily in transport. Today, this cheese is popular throughout the country, and it is highly valued as an accompaniment to many traditional dishes and as a basic ingredient in regional pastries, puddings, and cakes. It is eaten fresh with a sprinkling of salt and pepper, or as a dessert mixed with honey, nuts, or traditional ab\u00f3bora de doce (sweet pumpkin preserves).\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "Portugal caralho!", "thank you sir cheesiness", "Are you posting per country?

Due to the extra cream added during production, Vignotte is exceptionally fatty with nearly 75% fat. Nevertheless, this process gives the cheese a powdery white bloomy skin and an intensely creamy, light, rich, buttery texture. It has a slightly lemony taste making it perfect for grilling. Suitable for vegetarians. With such strong flavour, Vignotte adds an extra burst of flavour to a bland cracker or biscuit.

Milking is done by hand, after which the milk is heated, salted, and curdled using thistle extract. The curd is formed into cheeses, which are left to ripen in humid and cold conditions. The cheese has a creamy, semi-soft interior that is yellowish-white in color, while its flavor is clean, sweet, and slightly sour. This cheese is Portugal's oldest, most traditional food product with international acclaim. In the 13th century, the king of Portugal opened the first cheese market in Celorico da Beira, in the Serra da Estrela mountain range, where the cheese is still produced today. This cheese was even present on some of the first ships to sail to the New World. Serra da Estrela is traditionally consumed as an appetizer or dessert, and it pairs well with regional wines from the D\u00e3o region and broa\u2014local cornbread. A product rich in tradition and culture, Serra da Estrela cheese is the pride of the region, and it is considered the father of all sheep cheeses in Portugal.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "I love this cheese!", "I love this  cheese!

It is an uncooked, pressed, hard cheese matured for 4-6 months before being sold to the market. The cheese is available throughout the year, but the finest produce is available during the spring and summer months when the flavour of the milk is more pronounced. Ardi Gasna has a wheel shape with natural, crusty, yellow rind with greyish moulds. It has a hard texture but feels rich in the mouth. The flavours are clean and fresh, with the sweetness of mountain flowers and a characteristic, defined nutty taste. As the cheese ages, it strikes a perfect balance between sharpness and mildness. The orange-yellow rind and firm, supple pate of the Gasna work their way through on the cheeseboard.  A salad topped with Gasna or paired with jam as dessert tastes delectable as well. Ardi Gasna and Red C\u00f4tes de Bordeaux Merlot, Cabernet-Franc, Cabernet-Sauvignon or Malbec grapes will provide a fascinating mix.\n\nAlso as a note, I gained control of r/dailycheese and now post my cheese there as well as in r/cheese", "there is no such thing as to much cheese", "Just wondering if you will ever run out of cheeses...", "Oh day 365 can you post craft singles?", "Pal, give up!

If any of you know some cheeses that I haven\u2019t done yet I would love some input!\n\nHere is your daily cheese facts: Bel Paese, meaning \u2018beautiful country\u2019 in Italian, is a semi-soft cheese from the Lombardy region. It was formulated by Egidio Galbani in 1906 who wanted to invent a product that would compete with French Alpine cheeses. The name is derived from a book by Abbot Antonio Stoppani \"Il Bel Paese\", published in 1873. The cheese has a milky aroma infused with a mild buttery flavour. The taste can be compared with Mozzarella and St. Paulin. The pale yellow cheese may occasionally be riddled with \u201ceyes\u201d. The cheese is hard to spread but soft enough to slice. It is wrapped in a waxed, foil or plastic rind. Bel Paese takes 6 to 8 weeks to mature and comes in several different sizes from small buttons to large 5lb wheels. An original Bel Paese can be identified by a map of Italy and a picture of Antonio Stoppani on the label of the cheese. The American version has a map of United States on the label. The Italian cheese goes well with fruits like apples, pears and figs. As it has good melting capacity, it is often used in casseroles, hot Panini, focaccio or on a pizza. It can be eaten with fruity wines, such as dry red or white.\n\nAlso as a note, I gained control of r/dailycheese and now post my cheese there as well as in r/cheese", "You are doing the Lord's work.", "When you get to day 365 I dibs the post on r/madlads", "That stuff is so good.

Its texture is smooth and creamy. In flavor, it is similar to cream cheese (milky, tangy, acidic, smooth), but fromage frais is much lower in fat. It's important not to confuse it with fromage blanc, which doesn't contain live cultures, while fromage frais does. The cheese is often used as an accompaniment to caviar, but it can also be enriched with fruit or honey.

The cheese is made from pasteurized goat's milk and ages for 6 to 8 weeks. It's shaped into a log, or to be more precise, mule's hoof. The distinctive rind is covered in gray and black mold. The aromas are intense, barnyardy and goaty, while the flavors are pungent, tangy, lemony, and acidic, depending on age. The texture of Monte Enebro is dense, brittle, and chalky when young, but with age it breaks down and becomes runny. It's recommended to add the cheese to a beetroot salad or fry it in tempura batter before serving it with orange blossom honey.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "Would this be similar to a blue cheese?", "One of my favourites. Unbelievably silky.", "Grand job", "No; it's a straight up goat's milk cheese. It's probably most comparable to the French cheese, Boucheron.

It\u2019s base is a fresh goat cheese but the rind is developed with the penicillium roqueforti strain so you will get some of that blue cheese flavor, just not a lot because it\u2019s not mixed into the paste or ripened that much. \n\nIt\u2019s delicious and I loved selling this cheese.", "Thanks!", "Came here to say this!

If any of you know some cheeses that I haven\u2019t done yet I would love some input!\n\nHere is your daily cheese facts: Burrino is a traditional Italian cheese hailing from Basilicata, but it's also produced using similar techniques in Campania, Molise, and Calabria. The cheese consists of an exterior layer of soft cheese and an interior of butter from the whey. The cheese is made from Podolica cow's milk, while the butter is chilled and inserted into the cheese. Burrino is shaped into a string purse (or a pear), and it's tied near the top before it's immersed in hot water. The texture is creamy, while the aromas are pungent. Burrino ripens for several weeks, and it's usually consumed by eating the butter on bread first, followed by the cheese. It's believed that the cheese was invented before refrigeration in order to preserve butter from going rancid.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "misread as burrito xdd though looks good"], "urlNames": [], "urlLink": [[], [], []]}

The aromas are reminiscent of mushrooms, wood, and smoke, while the flavors are complex and savory \u2013 first, it tastes of wood and smoke, but then it develops the flavors of hazelnuts.

The mold is pretty hardy, but the cheese can get a bit damp and oozy if kept in vacuum for a long time.

It is a thermophilic, artisan cheese made using unpasteurised Montbeliarde cow's milk. The cheese takes its name from Baothan or Brethan, the founder of the monastic settlement at Lannleire. Glebe Brethan is a mellow cheese having fruity and creamy flavours when young. As it matures, the cheese becomes more aromatic with spicy, nutty flavours penetrating the paste. It is smooth, pale yellow in colour with occasional holes and crystallisation in older cheeses. The honey coloured to greyish beige rind emits a very earthy aroma. The cheese is hugely versatile and can be melted over a variety of dishes including fondue. It is available in 40 - 45kg wheels.\n\nAlso as a note, I gained control of r/dailycheese and now post my cheese there as well as in r/cheese\n\nAnother Note: These cheese types are starting to get more and more difficult to find so I would love it if anyone could point me to a resource or list that has every single type of cheese and possibly their image.

On the outside, it is buttery, mild, sweet, fresh, and slightly salty, while the inside is milky and piquant. The cheese melts in the mouth easily, leaving notes of warm melted butter on the palate.

The natural rind hides a dry, smooth, and creamy texture. After 70 days of aging, the cheese develops a basket-weave pattern. The aromas are fresh and milky, while the flavors are mild, earthy, subtle, fruity, and sweet with a nutty finish. It's recommended to pair it with fresh fruit, grilled vegetables, or cured meat.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "Love it", "Back when I was a cheesemonger, there was a local distributor that had a statue of the P'tit Basque shepherd boy in their office.

It's recommended to serve it with bagels and fruit as a tasty snack. This cheese was originally sold in saloons where it was served as an alternative to pickled eggs, hence the name Breakfast Cheese.\nThe small version is known as Petite Breakfast, made with the addition of a dollop of fresh cream to the mix.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "Once you run out of  cheese, a hungry John Cleese might show up.", "Keep up the great work!", "One of my absolute favourite cheeses.

If any of you know some cheeses that I haven\u2019t done yet I would love some input!\n\nHere is your daily cheese facts: Huntsman is a concoction of two classic cheeses produced in the English countryside. Double Gloucester is a firm, mellow and tangy cheese made only from the milk of Gloucester cows in southwestern England while Stilton Blue cheese is a blue-veined, strong, smooth and creamy cheese with a distinctive flavour profile. Though the combination seems unusual, the English cheesemakers have made it possible by presenting a layered representation of the two cheeses. Stilton is sandwiched between layers of satiny Double Gloucester, resulting in a powerful flavour combination of the two. It is a difficult cheese to cook with, but visually stunning on a cheese platter. Each cheese could have its own wine pairing, but together they go well with ales and beers.\n\nAlso as a note, I gained control of r/dailycheese and now post my cheese there as well as in r/cheese", "An exquisite cheese.

I don\u2019t like that cause there\u2019s no variety or different sizes, plus it tastes better when it\u2019s fresh cracked.\n\nTo crack a wheel like this there are parm knives. It\u2019s difficult to describe without visuals but here goes.  \n\nThere\u2019s 4 different types in the parm knife kit.  The first has a hooked handle.  Think a much smaller version of what the Dothraki use in game of thrones. You use this to score all around the wheel.  Since the wheels are required to be aged at least 2 years to be called Reggiano, they have a really thick really hard sad rind (great for soups!!) so you need to score through it first.\n\nNext you have the dagger of the group.  This is the longest one with the sharpest blade.  You push this deep into the scored line to dig deep into the wheel.  This can sometimes separate the wheel on its own, especially a younger one.\n\nLastly, you have two short blunt..wedges, for lack of a better word.  Now that the cheese is scored and has a deep division between the two halves, you use the wedges to pry it apart in half.\n\nThat\u2019s a brief description, hope it made some sense.

Since 2002, it has been awarded the AOP label, which makes it essential that the 32 selected valley and mountain dairies producing this cheese comply with the strict quality requirements. It is a full fat cheese containing 45% of fat in dry matter. Sbrinz AOP is a 100% natural product since it made from first-class raw milk, rennet and salt without any additives. It takes extremely long time for the cheese to mature, a minimum of 18 months before it can be savored. The longer the cheese is matured, the more aromatic and spicy it tastes. It can be eaten in three different ways, depending on the age of cheese. At 18 months Sbrinz can be sliced or shaved into rolls. At the age of 24 months or even longer, Sbrinz develops its full flavour and is served as an aperitif or broken up into pieces (\u201cM\u00f6ckli\u201d) on a cheeseboard. Last but not the least, grated Sbrinz with its spicy aroma is perfect for adding a finishing to many pasta, risotto or au gratin dishes. This versatile cheese is often used instead of Parmesan cheese in Swiss cuisine.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "How many types of cheese are there", "[deleted]", "There\u2019s few things more consistent than vsusduck and I appreciate the fuck out of them", "God that cheese was the bane of my existence when I was still mongering.

It is magnificent. I get to spend all day with cheese, sneaking expensive bits of cheese and meat and just generally having fun being a cheese person. \n\nHowever what I did not love was the charcuterie board rush just before Christmas. The owner either didn\u2019t realise how much time it takes to prep a charcuterie board or didn\u2019t care. I came into work on the 23rd of December and was faced with 35 charcuterie board orders to prep. That meant; cutting, weighing prepping and artistically assembling individual cheese, meats, and garnishes for 35 different orders. Each box typically takes one hour to prepare, and cost $250.\n\nI was the only staff member with kitchen experience, and the only way to get this done was assembly line kitchen style. First I took over all the counter space in front of house, it wasn\u2019t enough so I took over all counter space in the back area too, still wasn\u2019t enough to we just huffed a few tables from the restaurant next door into the back space to have room. \n\nThen I stole the meat slicer and ran off with it to my land of charcuterie boards, then I ran off with all the cheeses from the display. Then I had a nervous breakdown and cried. Then I had a cigarette and some Etorki cheese and felt better. \n\nThen we just had to shut down store service to get the boards finished, and had the other guy working just slicing 100g weights of all the cheeses was had available to put them out at needed while I did the same with meats. Then we reconvened for basic assembly in each box, then did garnishes, then did artistic presentation for each box. Then we cried some more, then we got drunk. \n\nWe managed to get fucking 35 boxes done in 6 hours. We made the owner 35x250\u2026 $8,750. \n\nIt was like walking in to the biggest dinner rush of the year, and discovering no-one had done any prep for the evening and your only co-worker was the new guy. \n\nI demand a raise.", "Am I the only person who feels that the modern trend for \u2018opulent\u2019 cheese boards looks awful? \n\n1) They are too crammed, which looks stressful but also there\u2019s no space to slice a cheese etc \n2) There is too much choice and it\u2019s visually jarring \n3) Things are all mixed up, for example often the cracker types are distributed everywhere and that is annoying. Figs everywhere aaagh!\n4) It feels like showing off / trying to look opulent and that feels try-hard to me?", "Well yeah obviously it's just for looks.

The aromas are mild, while the flavors are delicate when young, becoming more intense with aging.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "You should have done this for 1000, millstone, Milestone.", "Don't ever run out of cheese!", "man your dedication is sky high", "How is this still going on", "3 years long of types of cheese", "That is clever.

It is produced in the provinces of Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona, Lecco, Lodi, Milan and Monza-Brianza, and considered to be a member of the Stracchino cheese family, however, it needs to ripen for much longer than other varieties; at least 75 days. In the past, the milk was traditionally skimmed of cream to make butter, and this cheese was produced to save (It. salvare) the excess milk from spoiling, hence the name Salva Cremasco. This cheese has a smooth and moist rind, and the paste varies from creamy to crumbly closer to the center. Aging in caves delivers a fresh and sharp herbal aromas, while the taste is balanced out by earthy notes. Salva Cremasco is traditionally used in a local dish called Salva con le Tighe (green Lombardian peppers in vinegar), and best enjoyed accompanied with white wines or lagers.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "You are a maniac in every food way.(misspelled good as food but i decided to keep it).\n\nApril 25th of this year, youll reach day 1000(maybe) good luck amazing stranger!", "Happy 900th cheese day!", "This is the first of your posts I\u2019ve ever seen.

The curds are then strained and pressed firm into a block to then cut into cubes.

Jim Wallace recipe: [https://cheesemaking.com/products/paneer-cheese-making-recipe](https://cheesemaking.com/products/paneer-cheese-making-recipe)\n\nIf you want to add spices, etc, just add them to the curd when you put it in the cheese cloth.

Semi-aged and ripened for 5 to 10 weeks, B\u00fbcheron is traditionally produced in short logs that are sliced and sold as small rounds in stores. It is recommended to use B\u00fbcheron in salads, sandwiches, with crusty bread, chutneys, fruit jams, or crackers.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "Just a few days off two years!", "This is the cheese that started it all for me.

If any of you know some cheeses that I haven\u2019t done yet I would love some input!\n\nHere is your daily cheese facts: Azeit\u00e3o is a semi-soft cheese made from unpasteurized sheep milk. The origins of this cheese date back to the 19th century, when Gaspar Henriques de Paiva emigrated to the town of Azeit\u00e3o. Out of nostalgia for his place of birth, he imported black dairy sheep from his home town to Azeit\u00e3o and brought cheesemakers from Beira Baixa to make cheeses. De Paiva's Azeit\u00e3o cheeses quickly became famous throughout Portugal, winning several awards at agricultural fairs. The milk for this cheese is taken from sheep that graze on natural vegetation in the pastures of Azeit\u00e3o. The sheep are milked manually, and the milk is mixed with the extract of a local variety of thistle to start the curdling process instead of animal rennet, meaning the cheese is 100% vegetarian. Salt is added to the curd, which is then manually worked and wrapped into muslin cloth bundles, called cinchos. The finished cheese is round and flat with a yellowish crust concealing a light-colored interior with a semi-solid consistency. The flavor is both sour and salty with herby undertones. This runny cheese is best served scooped onto a slice of fresh bread, and also makes a delicious dessert when paired with fruit and a semi-dry white wine.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "Loving the Portuguese cheeses of late", "The Portuguese series happening is amazing.

Some people call it Red Ring cheese because of the red wax coating. Though sometimes compared to farmer's cheese, it is different because no cream or salt is added to the cheese. Since the cheese is not aged, the texture remains soft and it spoils very fast. These days it is very rare to find the cheese commercially because of its neutral taste and short-lived shelf life. It is available in small grocery shops, gas stations and restaurants in the south of the United States where the farmer or grocer sells the cheese fresh off the wheel. Hoop cheese is a mild, slightly salty cheese with a rubbery texture when young which becomes sharp and crumbly if allowed to age. The colour of the pate is rich yellow with a subtle nutty flavour. It is an excellent cooking ingredient that is used to give a creamy texture to the dish without changing the flavour or making it stickier. Use it to make grilled sandwiches, macaroni and cheese or have it with crackers or fruits.\n\nAlso as a note, I gained control of r/dailycheese and now post my cheese there as well as in r/cheese", "Good memories of old country stores in Mississippi.", "It looks like Gouda that had food coloring added or something", "I\u2019m from the south and my grandfather used to get this cheese all the time.

During those days, only the wealthy and commercial establishments had access to refrigerators. In the summers, middle class households had to store their dairy products in iceboxes cooled with ice blocks. Cheeses could not compete with milk and butter for a place in the icebox and had to fend for themselves.  Consumers requested for a variant of Monterey Jack that would not become runny in the summers. The solution was Dry Jack, a hard cheese, aged from ten months to upto four years. Firm in texture with a pale yellow pate, the cheese has a rich, nutty yet mild and assertive flavour. As the cheese ages Dry Jack wheels become increasingly brittle. As the cheese is similar in texture to Parmesan, it makes a good substitute for churning and grating over salads, pasta, soups or tacos. The cheese can be shred, cooked, sliced or even eaten as it is. You will never go wrong by grating Dry Jack over casseroles, toasted cheese sandwiches, omelets and souffl\u00e9s. Consider Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Rose, Shiraz or Zinfandel with a Dry Jack.\n\nAlso as a note, I gained control of r/dailycheese and now post my cheese there as well as in r/cheese", "Got me all hype!", "For the love of Pearl!", "I love the name of this cheese.

If any of you know some cheeses that I haven\u2019t done yet I would love some input!\n\nHere is your daily cheese facts: Ossau-Iraty (or Esquirrou) is a traditional, unpasteurised ewe's milk cheese from the picturesque mountains of Pyrenees that hold a fertile grazing land for the milk-giving ewes. This cheese unites two regions of France in the Western Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es: Ossau valley of Bearn and Iraty Forest of Basque Country. It received an AOC protection in 1980, which requires that the cheese be produced with the milk of only two breeds of ewes - Manech and Basco-B\u00e9arnaise. An uncooked and pressed cheese, Ossau-Iraty is semi-hard in texture with a thick, buff rind marked with rust and grey moulds. Beneath the brown and orange rind is an ivory white, supple and slightly grainy interior that has a creamy and buttery mouth feel. Flavours are herbaceous, nutty and fruity if the produce is from winter while the summer cheeses tend to reveal aromas of grass and flowers. Matured for at least 6 months, Ossau-Iraty often comes in a flat cylindrical shape. There are three main sizes available, small (Petit-Ossau-Iraty-Brebis Pyrenes), intermediate (non-fermier) and large (fermier). It is sometimes dusted with paprika leaves to add a kick of flavour. It tastes delicious with fruity red, full-bodied red or white wines such as Zinfandel, Tempranillo or Syrah.\n\nAlso as a note, I gained control of r/dailycheese and now post my cheese there as well as in r/cheese", "Best eaten with a side of cherry marmalade.

The cheese is soft and moist in texture, with a typical milky flavor. It is often compared to mozzarella regarding both the texture and the flavors. Malaka is always consumed after it has been cooked. Due to its sweet, milky flavor and a soft, malleable texture, it is often used as a filling for kalitsounia pies.

This fresh skuta is low in fat and it's full of healthy Omega-3, protein, calcium, and zinc. The cheese is very versatile and it's recommended to use it in cheese cakes or flavor it with orange liqueur and serve it with fresh fruit. \n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "I am so proud of you for continuing to do this.", "You rock!", "it looks like mozarella!", "You\u2019ve dedicated more this than I have to anything in my whole life.

My grandma thought me that it was done before to have longer lasting butter that was made from whey. Skuta is poor man's dinner, it is made so any remaining cheese bits in whey float to the surface and can be discarded, but in it's case it's strained trough a clot and it makes a soft cheese like product. It's shelf life even in fridge is about 3 days. It goes hard, inedible and smelly. Basically poor people ate it and it was a way to feed a family in the middle of winter when there was not a lot of food. Today like with most things is marketed as a delicacy. Not that there is anything wrong with skuta but not many places double boil whey just to get about 2-3kilos of it in about 120l of whey.

This semi-soft cheese is traditionally made from buffalo's milk, although cow's milk is mostly used in recent years because buffalo's milk is rare. Dangke is coagulated with a papaya latex enzyme called papain instead of rennet. The papaya leaves are bitter, so the producers must be careful to mix it correctly, otherwise the cheese might be too bitter. The texture of Dangke is elastic and chewy, similar to tofu, and it usually comes wrapped in banana leaves. The cheese doesn't melt easily, so it's often eaten as it is or pan-fried in oil after it's been marinated in garlic and coriander. Dangke is often eaten with rice, and it's believed that the name stems from the Dutch phrase dank u (wel), meaning thank you, a phrase that's been uttered by the Dutch on their first visit to South Sulawesi when they were presented with this cheese.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "You are the definition of commitment.", "The onigiri of cheeses", "Looks dank", "Sounds intriguing.

Interestingly, the rind is so important that it is prohibited to sell grated Laguiole, and each piece of the cheese must come with a piece of its rind.\nIt was first made by monks in a local monastery, who then gave the recipe to the mountain farmers. The maturation takes at least four months at a temperature lower than 14 \u00b0C. Laguiole possesses a creamy, rich texture on the inside that instantly melts in the mouth, providing a sharp, slightly sour taste. Try it with light red wines or dry white wines for the best pairing combination. The cheese is traditionally used to prepare aligot, a creamy dish of mashed potatoes and cheese.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "Upvote for the cheese and sheer dedication.", "Oh one of my faves!

The cheese is made from raw full cream milk and vegetable rennet obtained from pistils of artichoke thistle. Once matured for at least 60 days, it displays a waxy yellow rind and the imprints of esparto grass in which it is molded. The flavour graph varies according to its age, ranging from buttery when it is young and bitter when it is mature. During maturing, the cheese turns into deliciously runny and almost liquidy paste. A fully matured La Serena has a creamy consistency that can be scooped out after cutting out the circular lid. The intense bitter yet pleasant flavour tastes best with bread or toast. \n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "I think you should post a pic of Paneer if you have not.", "It's truly mindblowing to know there are so many types of cheese.  \nKeep up the good work!", "It looks like Camembert\u2019s gooeyer Spanish cousin.

The cheese is made from goat's milk and it's easily distinguishable by its natural, wrinkly, ashy rind. Underneath the rind, the texture is firm and dense, but it becomes soft and crumbly on the palate. As it ages, the texture softens, becoming silky smooth, especially near the rind. The aromas are fresh and goaty, while the flavors are sharp, tangy, and lemony. The name Grey Owl refers not only to the color of the rind, but it also honors one of Canada's first conservationist \u2013 Archie Belaney, a.k.a. Grey Owl.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "Wow, I thought that was a really old hamburger patty", "I hope it tastes better than it looks.

The aroma is pleasant, while the flavors are tart, lemony, and tangy. When young, it has a fresh grassiness, but as it ages, the paste develops a gooey texture with earthy hints. It's recommended to pair Rondo with a glass of Saison or Pinot Noir.\n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.", "And here I was hoping that \"Rondo Alla Turca\" was about cheese this whole time.", "Thank goodness. I think I missed some and thought you'd run out. Your posts always seem to be a challenge to me cheese demon.", "I have been with this since day 3", "Woah!

It's for Italian dishes mostly and does not melt easily due to it's age and low moisture content. Sprinkle on pasta or mix into pasta sauce for best results. It's a primary ingredient in pesto. Personally I like to put as much of it as possible into my pasta. \n\nBuratta is an italian cheese and is generally sold like wet mozzarella. It uses mozzarella and cream to make it. Eat it with bread, a sprinkle of salt and a high quality olive oil similar to how you'd eat mozzarella. \n\nSt Angel is a french cheese similar to brie. Use it as you would brie, in other words good bread, and fruit if you're so inclined. \n\nGjetost is a relatively uncommon cheese, and it's from Norway. It's actually served for breakfast on toast. Coffee is a good match for it apparently. Melting it isn't as easy as other cheeses, and it's used sometimes in deserts. \n\nBellavitano despite it's italian sounding name it's from Wisconsin in the USA. It's nutty and creamy and used on pasta. \n\nTaleggio is an Italian cheese famous for it's strong smell. It's actually quite mild and has a fruity flavour. It's a semi-soft cheese, and is good in pasta, grilled cheeses, and to eat on it's own. (Not actually sure about this one, I don't know much about it.)", "The hard cheeses keep longer than the soft cheeses. Start with the ones that expire first and use them for cooking too.

You can also just eat it as it is, also works very well with olive oil.

My boyfriend thinks coffee ruins the caramel taste, and brings out more of the goat flavour in the cheese. He can't stand the combo, but maybe some people like it?\n\nMy suggestion is: cut a plain donut in half, like a bagel (or you can use a bagel). Spread some butter on it, and then a couple of slices of the brown cheese. Put a teaspoon of raspberry or strawberry jam on top. Or if you want to try to make the legendary norwegian VAFFEL, it is the perfect recipe for brown cheese. This is so good I make them for lunch as often as I bother.

Yum!! Do you live in France or Canada?", "Looks and sounds amazing. For anyone interested, black garlic is simple to make. Since this is a cheese sub, I assume everyone has the patience to make it.\n\nWhat you need: \n\nGarlic - whole or peeled (recommended)\n\nRice cooker\n\n7 - 10 days\n\nOlive (recommended) or veg oil\n\nAll you have to do is fill the rice cooker with the garlic and leave it on the warm setting for about 7-10 days. The warm setting is usually around 165-175 degrees f. Do not start the garlic in the cook mode or it will turn to mush. Just set the cooker on the warm/hold setting.\n\nYou can use whole cloves but it's a bit of hassle to remove from the skin when it's finished which is why I recommend picking up a tub of bulk peeled from Costco or somewhere.\n\nFind a location outside of your home where you can safely plug in the rice cooker. You DO NOT want to do this inside or else your home will smell of garlic for months to come. If you don't have an outdoor plug consider if you can run an extension cord from somewhere.\n\nI recommend a light stir around the five day mark. I usually just pick up the cooker and tilt it left and right so that the garlic shifts around a bit. Depending on how much garlic you have in there this is much better than a mechanical stir with spoon or spatula. You can check it's progress at anytime but I generally only leave the lid open for less than 30 seconds to make sure the temperature stays stable. By day seven you should have very very dark brown to black garlic and it should have an almost rubbery bounce to it when touched. Do a taste test. You want a sweet and deep umami flavor. If it's to your liking then it is done, if not keep testing every day until it suits you, but don't go too long, you don't want mush.\n\nTransfer the garlic from the cooker into a plastic container and then fully cover with your oil. You want the oil level to be above the garlic. Chill in the fridge. The oil will pick up the flavors of the garlic so it is wonderful to cook with and the garlic will last for ages so you've always got some around to cook with in a dish, put onto your charcuterie board or even your next wheel of homemade cheese.", "It looks good!

The taste is quite complex for such a young cheddar, it definetly melds well with the black garlic. The flavor from the b.g. had an almost sweetness similar to a specialty honey (ie buckwheat honey), with dark chocolate undertones, rich umami flavor.
