The breasts I bought made between 4-6 strips.\nScramble your eggs in a bowl.\nTake your Panko crumbs and pour into a separate bowl, and mix your seasonings in the bread crumbs.  \nDip the slices into the egg mix, then roll around in the crumb/seasoning mix.\nLastly, fry them up!  They cook in about 4.5 minutes\n**WARNING!** Depending on the size of your fryer, only put a couple strips in at a time to avoid overflow.  (I did this accidentally)\nYour fryer ***will*** need cleaning afterwards, as its really messy, but ***please*** let it cool down before you clean it.  \n\nAlso, if you make these, let me know how they came out.
